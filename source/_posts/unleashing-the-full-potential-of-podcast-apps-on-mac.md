![apple podcasts interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/podcast-app-for-mac-4.jpg)

Although music-centered, Spotify features over 3.2 million podcasts, including several exclusive ones. Like Apple Podcasts, Spotify provides an audiophile-grade streaming experience. But it also has limited features compared to the most dedicated podcast players, allowing you to manage and organize your favorite shows efficiently. Also, features like Podcast ratings help beginners filter lousy content from good and discover what resonates with other users sharing the same interests and passions.

| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

Pocket Casts does not have a huge following as the above two podcast apps for Mac, maybe because it is a fairly recent service.

Available across significant OS, Pocket Casts allows you to seamlessly switch from one device to another. Another noteworthy feature is its advanced search and navigation functions, enabling you to locate your favorite shows quickly.

| **What we like:**                                               | **What we don't like:**                     |

| Discover recommendations that are a game changer for beginners. | Dedicates half of the features to creators. |
| Exceptional Playback control and audio effects.                 | It does not have some famous podcasts.      |

Podbean hosts a range of content, but it needs to include some famous ones. Still, it contains podcasts covering almost all subjects, and there's a good chance that you'll always have your hands on something to listen to. In addition, its playback features are one of a kind that allows you to add effects, trim silences, and boost audio while listening.

![podcast bean interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/podcast-app-for-mac-10.jpg)

Podbean gives you an ad-free experience for less than US$ 9.99/year. However, many of the features on the interface are made for the creators. All in all, Podbean is more suitable if you want to create podcasts besides listening to them.

## Part 4\. What To Look for in a Podcast App for Mac?

Of course, you must be curious about which criterion we have shortlisted the above best podcast apps for Mac. Here's what you have to look for when trying to choose the best podcast app for Mac:

### l App availability

Being the best podcast for Mac does not mean it must be available for macOS only. On the contrary, you should be able to seamlessly access the podcast episode from where you left off on another device. That is why it is best to choose a podcast app available across all devices.

### l Cost-value

Some podcast apps for Mac are costlier than others. However, there are better ways to go than the cheap ones. In contrast, a higher cost does not necessarily mean it is the right one. A good podcast app for Mac must charge you for the features offered, i.e., look at whether it is cost-effective or not.

### l Can the podcast show be found in the app?

Search, and navigation is one of the most critical, if not the most vital, aspects of a good podcast app for Mac. For context, it should allow you to quickly navigate to the episode you are looking for, eliminating the need for endless scrolling. Furthermore, the platform should allow you to save and build profiles for quick access and efficient use.

### l User friendly

Does the platform have a good interface? Does it allow you to quickly locate, save, and personalize your experience? Does the app crash? All these characteristics should be thoroughly examined. Of course, all the podcast apps for Mac mentioned in this list have good UI.

## Final Words

Hopefully, you must have found a podcast app for Mac that suits your needs and includes the topics and subjects you're most interested in.

Luminary Podcast is regarded as the "Netflix of podcasting" by many, given the range of exclusive content by the likes of Dave Chappelle, Lena Dunham, and Russell Brand. But, of course, all the premium content is accessible only to the subscribers, and to be one, you have to pay a hefty subscription price of US$ 7.99/mo.

![luminary interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/podcast-app-for-mac-9.jpg)

When it comes to features, Luminary will satisfy you.

**Price:** Free / 9.99 per month (with in-app purchases).

**Available OS**: Mac, Android, Windows, and iOS.

| **What we like:**                                               | **What we don't like:**                     |

| Discover recommendations that are a game changer for beginners. | Dedicates half of the features to creators. |
| Exceptional Playback control and audio effects.                 | It does not have some famous podcasts.      |

Podbean hosts a range of content, but it needs to include some famous ones. Still, it contains podcasts covering almost all subjects, and there's a good chance that you'll always have your hands on something to listen to. In addition, its playback features are one of a kind that allows you to add effects, trim silences, and boost audio while listening.

![podcast bean interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/podcast-app-for-mac-10.jpg)

Podbean gives you an ad-free experience for less than US$ 9.99/year. However, many of the features on the interface are made for the creators. All in all, Podbean is more suitable if you want to create podcasts besides listening to them. However, given you can find all the content on some other platform, it has nothing unique that forces you to stick with it, and it is best to choose a robust podcast player for Mac like Pocket Casts, Spotify, or Luminary over this.

**Key Features**

* **Exceptional playback controls**. Add effects, trim silences, and boost audio while listening.
* **Dedicated podcast studio (for creators).** Create a high-definition podcast, limit background interference, and make your podcast seem professional.
* **Discovery and recommendations**. Podbean covers all the necessary subjects and allows you to find something suiting your interests, hobbies, and passions.

| **What we like:**                          | **What we don't like:**                            |

Podurama is another cross-platform podcast app that Mac users will like, given it includes over 700K podcasts and more than a million episodes. Available for all major devices, Podurama allows you to switch from one device to another seamlessly. It also lets you create custom profiles, bookmark favorite shows, and find relevant content efficiently.

![pocket casts interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/podcast-app-for-mac-11.jpg)

It is a free app with minimal ads, so if you are looking for a free podcast app for Mac, Podurama is the way to go. Although free, Podurama will not disappoint you with its features, given that it includes exceptional playback options, like changing speed, trimming silences, casting on another device, and built-in Bluetooth support.

**Available OS**: Mac, Android, Windows, and iOS.

**App Store Rating:** 4.3 out of 5 (2.2K Ratings)

| **What we like:**                           | **What we don't like:** |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Search, subscribe to, and download audio.   | Poor sound quality.     |
| iCloud Syncing with other iOS devices.      |                         |

| Browse and download older podcast episodes. |                         |

Downcast has got everything covered and offers an ad-free experience for a nominal price. But it fails on one big aspect: the sound quality. It is a premium application but provides the excellent quality you get with Spotify's free version. Nevertheless, there are other exceptional features, like taking notes while listening.

![downcast interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/podcast-app-for-mac-12.jpg)

![castbox interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/podcast-app-for-mac-13.jpg)

Most of the content is free in Castbox, and unlike most podcast apps for Mac mentioned here, it does not limit exclusive features to free users. But it charges you high costs for listening to premium content. Still, given that it also features audiobooks and presents almost all popular podcasts, you do not have a different platform in the future. Moreover, its feature set is another win for the platform as it packs all the necessary features in a simple interface.

**Key Features**

* **Over 29 million podcast episodes.** Podcast Player - Castbox covers all the necessary subjects and allows you to find something suiting your interests, hobbies, and passions.

## Part 4\. What To Look for in a Podcast App for Mac?

Of course, you must be curious about which criterion we have shortlisted the above best podcast apps for Mac. Here's what you have to look for when trying to choose the best podcast app for Mac:

### l App availability

Being the best podcast for Mac does not mean it must be available for macOS only. On the contrary, you should be able to seamlessly access the podcast episode from where you left off on another device. That is why it is best to choose a podcast app available across all devices.

### l Cost-value

Some podcast apps for Mac are costlier than others. However, there are better ways to go than the cheap ones. In contrast, a higher cost does not necessarily mean it is the right one. A good podcast app for Mac must charge you for the features offered, i.e., look at whether it is cost-effective or not.

### l Can the podcast show be found in the app?

Search, and navigation is one of the most critical, if not the most vital, aspects of a good podcast app for Mac. For context, it should allow you to quickly navigate to the episode you are looking for, eliminating the need for endless scrolling. Furthermore, the platform should allow you to save and build profiles for quick access and efficient use.

### l User friendly

Does the platform have a good interface? Does it allow you to quickly locate, save, and personalize your experience? Does the app crash? All these characteristics should be thoroughly examined. Of course, all the podcast apps for Mac mentioned in this list have good UI.

## Final Words

Hopefully, you must have found a podcast app for Mac that suits your needs and includes the topics and subjects you're most interested in. We have included some ten podcast apps in the list for a reason. And that is to allow the users to examine the different types of podcast services offered and let them pick the most suitable one for them. Another aspect that we were more critical of was the availability of topics and podcast subjects covered in all the apps so that you always have your hands on something you can listen to without switching to a different platform.
