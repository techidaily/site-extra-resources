Not too long ago, Apple came up with the M1 chip MacBook, whose processor is faster and works even more efficiently.

However, the problem here is that Apple's M1 chip does not support some video editors. You may find installing a video editor on Mac M1 problematic if they lack compatibility with Apple's innovations. Don't worry because we have got you covered. With intense research, we managed to find video editing apps with incredible performance. Want to know the best part? Keep reading!

## Part 2: Best video editors on M1 chip

We have tested and installed various video editors on Mac M1 and discovered that the native apps work much better. Editing raw footage has never been easier until the introduction of the M1 chip. However, not all video editors are compatible with it. We did some research to find out the three best video editors that will make your life significantly easier. Here's the kicker:

### 1\. [Final Cut Pro](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/) \[for Apple Lover\]

Final Cut Pro is the ultimate video editor for all Apple lovers as it has M1's native support, which means all video editing processes work smoothly.

The intuitive app design makes it more beginner-friendly, and its compatibility with M1 chips enhances its speed six times.

Along with being native to the M1 chip, its multiple user integration and extended party plug-ins make it perform exceptionally well.

The audio stock is also one of its unique features, which helps make a video more expressive.

It gets better: With Adobe Premiere Pro's VR editing, VR audio editing, effects, text tools, transitions, etc., it is nearly impossible not to gain value. The price you pay to subscribe to its packages is worth it compared to the number of tools you get to avail.
