 The feature rich DJI Go mobile application assists users in easy settings for all features. App is connected via Wi-Fi support and it offers so many intuitive controls up to wide range of movements. When your drone is in air, you can easily send all useful commands from your application and best part is that it is also possible to have live view of things happening in air via mobile application. The DJI support application is updated time to time with all new set of features.
