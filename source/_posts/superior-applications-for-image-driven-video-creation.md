Many videomakers have had a good experience with the app and specially designed for mobile phones with Android operating systems. Surprisingly, most people have Android-supported mobile phones, just like you. Right? The name suggests that it is useful for trimming videos.

Nevertheless, it also supports many features like transcoding and frame grabbing, which you'll rarely find on other mobile apps that allow video editing. As a result, sometimes you may not want to purchase the app before trying it out. VidTrimPro offers you the opportunity to do that. That’s a good chance because you can use the trial version and judge whether it will be the best for your videos.

## Part 2 Use this software and make videos from photos with ease

An impressive presentation will require you to use the best software to make a video from photos for a compelling outcome. The way you make the production also needs to be fun when applying the transitions and animations to your pictures before they turn out to videos. A better type of software will also allow you to include some music in your videos.

Filmora is an easy-to-use software that allows cloud utilities to make videos. All you need is to import the images and record the background voice from your side. Other video makers are mainly limited to recording and application of effects. However, Wondershare Filmora is among the best software to make videos from photos because of its unique features. The steps to making videos using Wondershare Filmora are easy to follow. Here's how you can use Wondershare to make your presentation cool.

##### Step1 Add photos and videos

![add photos Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-import-media.jpg)

Place all your photos in one folder before creating your presentation project. Click the import menu to choose the folder where you had stored your photos. Choose the folder and select all the files you want to upload as they are automatically imported. Then, counter-check to confirm whether the medial files are visible in the project.

##### Step2 Fix imported files in the timeline section

![position media files Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/crop-to-fit-filmora9.jpg)

Select the "preferences" before positioning the photos for your videos. Next, click on the drop-down menu. Black bars will make your photos look bad, so you can crop them to ensure they coincide with the selected aspect ratio of 9:16\. You can still zoom the image at this point as well. Before exiting the editing tab, add transitions and animations to your photos without forgetting the slide timers.

Select the "Fit" option once done. Return to the media panel to include more photos and media in the timeline. You can drag-drop the required files from the folder to the location where you want. The remaining part is simple- repeat the process and arrange files in your desired order. Adjust the duration of each image or media for a better outcome.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![filmora timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/drag-n-drop-timeline.jpg)

##### Step3 Avoiding cuts in slides through transitions

![add transitions filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-slideshow-transitions.jpg)

Hard cuts distort the presentation, but you can evade them by using transitions. Filmora has many transitions that you can include in your presentation. Drag and drop them in the timeline. Also, avoid applying the same transition to all slides because this will look repetitive. Instead, make videos from photos with the song without the cut, including cuts in the slides for them to look great. Different transitions to different drops work best—Right-click on every slide to make necessary changes.

##### Step4 Application of filters/overlays to improve color

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://store.absolute.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4601998&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ef70e26a0b5da778eda3f48014d087cd/728x90_larger-shield.jpg" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![apply filters filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-filters-options.jpg)

The transitions tab is near the effects tab, with many visual effects that you can apply to your slides to make them catchier. You can filter the effects into categories and sub-categories like Light Leaks and Lomography. Apply an image filter by positioning it over the footage.

##### Step5 Include motion graphics

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://printrendy.pxf.io/c/5597632/1453719/17020" target="_top" id="1453719"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17020-1453719" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1453719/17020" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![add motion graphics Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-love-elements.jpg)

Although this part is not a must, it would be better to add moving images to your slides, making the video lively. You can select any graphics in the effects tab and include them in the slides. The application of the elements also depends on the reasons to create the presentation and including some visuals in the slides.

##### Step6 Add voice recordings and soundtracks

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1892108/21290" target="_top" id="1892108"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1892108" border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1080"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1892108/21290" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![record voiceover Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-voiceover-filmora9.jpg)

Select the voice recording feature in the media tab, which appears from the drop-down menu. All the recordings that you will create will be available in the media section. There are also useful features that you can find helpful to include in the slides to make the audio systematic. For example, suddenly, a microphone will appear to enable you to record the audio played in the background of the recorded video.

##### Step7 Export slides to Filmora

![export video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/go-to-export-panel.jpg)

Finally, you will have to export all the slides that you have created to Filmora. Click on the "Q" icon, and another window will appear on the screen. Frame the slides and export them to your online video-creating account like Vimeo or YouTube.

Creating many video slides will require a larger amount of space, up to 500 MBs, while creating a few short-form video will consume less space. Therefore, choose the best that you would like to create depending on your requirements.

## Part 3 Making videos from online photos

Select the "Fit" option once done. Return to the media panel to include more photos and media in the timeline. You can drag-drop the required files from the folder to the location where you want. The remaining part is simple- repeat the process and arrange files in your desired order. Adjust the duration of each image or media for a better outcome.

##### Step3 Avoiding cuts in slides through transitions

![add transitions filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-slideshow-transitions.jpg)

Hard cuts distort the presentation, but you can evade them by using transitions. Filmora has many transitions that you can include in your presentation. Drag and drop them in the timeline. Also, avoid applying the same transition to all slides because this will look repetitive. Instead, make videos from photos with the song without the cut, including cuts in the slides for them to look great. Different transitions to different drops work best—Right-click on every slide to make necessary changes.

##### Step4 Application of filters/overlays to improve color

![apply filters filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-filters-options.jpg)

The transitions tab is near the effects tab, with many visual effects that you can apply to your slides to make them catchier. You can filter the effects into categories and sub-categories like Light Leaks and Lomography. Apply an image filter by positioning it over the footage.

##### Step5 Include motion graphics

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![add motion graphics Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-love-elements.jpg)

Although this part is not a must, it would be better to add moving images to your slides, making the video lively. You can select any graphics in the effects tab and include them in the slides. The application of the elements also depends on the reasons to create the presentation and including some visuals in the slides.

##### Step6 Add voice recordings and soundtracks

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![record voiceover Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-voiceover-filmora9.jpg)

Select the voice recording feature in the media tab, which appears from the drop-down menu. All the recordings that you will create will be available in the media section. There are also useful features that you can find helpful to include in the slides to make the audio systematic. For example, suddenly, a microphone will appear to enable you to record the audio played in the background of the recorded video.

##### Step7 Export slides to Filmora

## Part 2 Use this software and make videos from photos with ease

An impressive presentation will require you to use the best software to make a video from photos for a compelling outcome.

A better type of software will also allow you to include some music in your videos.

The steps to making videos using Wondershare Filmora are easy to follow. Here's how you can use Wondershare to make your presentation cool.

##### Step1 Add photos and videos

Choose the folder and select all the files you want to upload as they are automatically imported. Then, counter-check to confirm whether the medial files are visible in the project.

##### Step2 Fix imported files in the timeline section

### 5 - VidTrimPro

![vidtrimpro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/vidtrimpro.jpg)

Many videomakers have had a good experience with the app and specially designed for mobile phones with Android operating systems.

Nevertheless, it also supports many features like transcoding and frame grabbing, which you'll rarely find on other mobile apps that allow video editing. As a result, sometimes you may not want to purchase the app before trying it out. VidTrimPro offers you the opportunity to do that. That’s a good chance because you can use the trial version and judge whether it will be the best for your videos.

## Part 2 Use this software and make videos from photos with ease

An impressive presentation will require you to use the best software to make a video from photos for a compelling outcome. The way you make the production also needs to be fun when applying the transitions and animations to your pictures before they turn out to videos. A better type of software will also allow you to include some music in your videos.

Filmora is an easy-to-use software that allows cloud utilities to make videos. All you need is to import the images and record the background voice from your side. Other video makers are mainly limited to recording and application of effects. However, Wondershare Filmora is among the best software to make videos from photos because of its unique features. The steps to making videos using Wondershare Filmora are easy to follow. Here's how you can use Wondershare to make your presentation cool.

##### Step1 Add photos and videos

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://tinyland.pxf.io/c/5597632/1793214/19135" target="_top" id="1793214"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793214" border="0" alt="" width="900" height="900"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793214/19135" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![add photos Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-import-media.jpg)

Place all your photos in one folder before creating your presentation project. Click the import menu to choose the folder where you had stored your photos. Choose the folder and select all the files you want to upload as they are automatically imported. Then, counter-check to confirm whether the medial files are visible in the project.

##### Step2 Fix imported files in the timeline section

![position media files Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/crop-to-fit-filmora9.jpg)

Select the "preferences" before positioning the photos for your videos. Next, click on the drop-down menu. Black bars will make your photos look bad, so you can crop them to ensure they coincide with the selected aspect ratio of 9:16\. You can still zoom the image at this point as well. Before exiting the editing tab, add transitions and animations to your photos without forgetting the slide timers.

Select the "Fit" option once done. Return to the media panel to include more photos and media in the timeline. You can drag-drop the required files from the folder to the location where you want. The remaining part is simple- repeat the process and arrange files in your desired order. Adjust the duration of each image or media for a better outcome.

![filmora timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/drag-n-drop-timeline.jpg)

##### Step3 Avoiding cuts in slides through transitions

![add transitions filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-slideshow-transitions.jpg)

Hard cuts distort the presentation, but you can evade them by using transitions. Filmora has many transitions that you can include in your presentation. Drag and drop them in the timeline. Also, avoid applying the same transition to all slides because this will look repetitive. Instead, make videos from photos with the song without the cut, including cuts in the slides for them to look great. Different transitions to different drops work best—Right-click on every slide to make necessary changes.

##### Step4 Application of filters/overlays to improve color

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398453/3022" target="_top" id="398453"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398453" border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="580" height="400"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398453/3022" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![apply filters filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-filters-options.jpg)

The transitions tab is near the effects tab, with many visual effects that you can apply to your slides to make them catchier. You can filter the effects into categories and sub-categories like Light Leaks and Lomography. Apply an image filter by positioning it over the footage.

##### Step5 Include motion graphics

![add motion graphics Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-love-elements.jpg)

Although this part is not a must, it would be better to add moving images to your slides, making the video lively. You can select any graphics in the effects tab and include them in the slides. The application of the elements also depends on the reasons to create the presentation and including some visuals in the slides.

##### Step6 Add voice recordings and soundtracks

<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075461/7443" target="_top" id="2075461"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075461" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075461/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![record voiceover Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-voiceover-filmora9.jpg)

Select the voice recording feature in the media tab, which appears from the drop-down menu. All the recordings that you will create will be available in the media section. There are also useful features that you can find helpful to include in the slides to make the audio systematic. For example, suddenly, a microphone will appear to enable you to record the audio played in the background of the recorded video.

##### Step7 Export slides to Filmora

![export video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/go-to-export-panel.jpg)

Finally, you will have to export all the slides that you have created to Filmora. Click on the "Q" icon, and another window will appear on the screen. Frame the slides and export them to your online video-creating account like Vimeo or YouTube.

Creating many video slides will require a larger amount of space, up to 500 MBs, while creating a few short-form video will consume less space. Therefore, choose the best that you would like to create depending on your requirements.

## Part 3 Making videos from online photos
