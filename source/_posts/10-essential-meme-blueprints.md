## Part 1\. Top 10 Meme Template Ideas

Social media doesn't have to be just serious and instructive. You may also enjoy it a little bit! Adding comedy or relevant material is really a terrific strategy to engage your readers. The decade's biggest cultural phenomena are memes. Every human phenomenon has a meme equivalent, but certain forms have shown to be more effective and durable over time than others, both in terms of narrative flexibility and the opportunity for innovative remixes. We've picked the top 10 meme templates below.

### 1\. Burning Paper

A year without a new SpongeBob meme is nothing. In this meme, SpongeBob may be seen reading a document with some mockery before burning it without looking back. This sample only demonstrates the lack of interest some individuals have in anything.

### 2\. They Can’t Read

What more effective approach to convey a point than via a meme? Using this template, you may express a strong or unpopular stance while simultaneously making snide remarks about others who disagree with you.

![they cant read](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/they-cant-read.jpg)

### 3\. I Am Once Again Asking

This priceless meme was lifted from one of Bernie Sanders' campaign materials. This example just demonstrates how desperate people would do anything, no matter how humiliating. And we apologize to Bernie personally for our shortcomings.

![im once again asking](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/im-once-again-asking.jpg)

### 4\. Draw 25

You know that feeling you get in the game of Uno when you just have one card and simply can't seem to obtain the card you need, so you keep drawing? This example only demonstrates the fact that certain choices aren't worthwhile at any price.

![draw 25](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/draw-25.jpg)

### 5\. I Pretend I Do Not See It

I Pretend I Do Not See It is another one on the list. There are times when we just do not want to see things, especially when they are complete and total disappointments, like the year 2020\. We have elected to become blind because we are too exhausted, and I believe I can speak for everyone when I say that.

![pretend dont see it](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/pretend-dont-see-it.jpg)

### 6\. Gossip Girl

This Gossip Girl-inspired meme template combines some intriguing questions with the show's logo's writing to create a humorous whole. This meme style consistently entertains, regardless of whether the comedy is in the question or the answer.

![gossip girl](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/gossip-girl.jpg)

### 7\. Return To Monke

If we were all monkeys, this epidemic would not have occurred. Absolutely, I say. Because of this, I and a vast majority of people think that we need to abandon a million years of development and go back to being monks.

![return to monke](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/return-to-monke.jpg)

### 8\. They Don’t Know

When you're at a party and people don't realize how much superior you are to them, isn't that upsetting? Everyone believes that it's okay, and this meme is proof of that.

![they dont know](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/they-dont-know.jpg)

### 9\. How It Started

In a year when everything remained same at all times, we were certainly preoccupied with looking for signs of advancement. Unfortunately, a lot of the time it felt like things were just getting worse.

![how it started](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-it-started.jpg)

### 10\. Doge vs. Cheems

We all know that the only individuals who have positive attitudes are those that exercise. For those individuals or canines, who don't, they may wish to begin soon.

![doge vs cheems](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/doge-vs-cheems.jpg)
