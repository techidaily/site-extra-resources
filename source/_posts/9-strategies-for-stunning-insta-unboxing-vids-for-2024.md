Unboxing reels on Instagram will never be out of trend; thus, you need to work on your unboxing skills. It is essential for you to create attractive reels because these reels can drive 67% more engagement to your page. The tips mentioned below can help you proficiently in your **unboxing Instagram** success:

### Tip 1: Good Camera Equipment and Recording Environment

You should have a good camera for shooting videos because it is a basic part of reels. If you shoot an **unboxing video on Instagram** without a good camera, it will bore the users. A high-quality camera will drive a high number of followers in a minimum time. A camera equipment like a tripod stand is a must for unboxing reels. With it, you can record reels without setting up the camera again and again.

As for the environment, make sure it's tidy. People will not only focus on unboxing, but this factor is also a fundamental part of good Instagram reels. Simply put, always work with high-quality cameras and equipment in a clean and aesthetically pleasing space.

![use good recording equipment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/unboxing-reels-on-instagram-3.jpg)

### Tip 2: Keep the Focus on the Product Throughout the Video

Make sure to set the focus of your camera before recording reels. **Unboxing the Instagram** page should always focus on showing the product in higher quality. Imagine you shoot a video of a makeup box from Sephora, and if the focus is not on the box but on the table, do you think viewers will like it? They will ultimately bounce back, impacting your page's followers and reels.

Thus, always give first priority to the product. It will be a positive thing for your unboxing influencer career. Keep your camera neat and clean, and check its focus from time to time while shooting the video.

### Tip 3: Keep the Video Short

This is very important that you do not exceed the time of Instagram reels. The ideal time limit for **unboxing videos on Instagram** is 15 to 60 seconds. Thus, make sure you never lengthen the video until necessary. It will help you give high-quality short and precise unboxing reels. Users can get what they are looking for in a limited time.

### Tip 4: Resize your Unboxing Reels to Fit Instagram

The ideal size of Instagramâ€™s **unboxing reels** is 1080x1920p. Confirm this resolution before posting a video so you will not face any problems in the future. Above all, there are both landscape and portrait reels, but the reliable ones are portrait. Posting the unboxing video in portrait mode will drive more followers to your page.

### Tip 5: Add Captions for Your Unboxing Reels

Unboxing captions for Instagram can be a very helpful thing for many users. If a user is deaf, he will definitely need captions because of hearing impairment. Other than this, many people love to watch videos without voices, so it can be a complementary thing for you. When you add captions to an Instagram reel, it will assist you in standing apart from your competitors.

People can get what you are saying more clearly. Moreover, not everyone can understand English, so captions can help them out in this scenario. Unboxing videos with captions will not affect the video's quality but will attract more followers to your page.

### Tip 6: Choose an Appealing Soundtrack to Tie Everything Together

Soundtracks increase your chances of going viral and help you promote a brand. A soothing soundtrack can improve engagement and also attract music lovers. Alongside the unboxing captions, music is also a must-have for Instagram reels. Thus, select a piece of music that is like a melody to the ears.

Don't try to add beatbox sounds in the videos because it will not suit them. However, you have to select a sound that matches the theme of your product. For example, selecting Disney music for toy unboxing Instagram is good. You can create an immersive and memorable user experience with an appealing soundtrack.

### Tip 7: Learn More From Others
