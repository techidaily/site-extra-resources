Watch your competitors' videos and jot down notes of the most intriguing parts. Rather than copying what your competition is doing, find a more a creative way to do it better. For example, I choose skin care review, before doing it I do research on how other creator do this kind of content for me to have an idea on how i deliver the information to my viewers. I make sure that i made my video different from others, straight to the point and always with the result of the product.

Try to reach out to similar users in your field and ask them out for an opportunity to work together on something interesting. Creator put a lot of work into video collaborations. They search for likeminded partners, brainstorm collab ideas, and film several videos together. But after all that work, the two creators get a priceless reward sharing their audiences. Doing research who to work with before deciding to collab some content creator will help you match with partners where you have a higher chance of gaining interested and engaged followers.

### YouTube Keywords, thumbnail and video Titles

YouTube keywords are the foundations of any great channel, and they're the best way to get traffic as a new creator. Adding relevant terms to your tittles and video description will help your content climb search result fast. Don't make the tittle too long and make your title be descriptive as to give your audience a sneak peek as to what the video all about. Create a custom human thumbnail because your video thumbnails are essentially the cover of your video, so you need it to be absolutely beyond engaging. Using annotations and relevant images as custom thumbnail for your YouTube videos will increases your videos click through rate. Thumbnail help you attract new users to your channel and if you are not designing catchy thumbnail you are missing out a lot.
