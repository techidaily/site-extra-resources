That being said, let's dive into a detailed review on Luminance HDR to find out more about how the tool can help users in their endeavors to create/edit HDR images

## Part 2: Review in detail on Luminance HDR

Luminance HDR software is a free tool and it offers users a simple way to create and edit HDR images efficiently. It identifies data correctly and it supports lots of decent features that users can take advantage of when executing HDR image editing or creation tasks.

We've outlined some of the features of Luminance HDR below;

1. HDR Editing
