## 2023’S Ideal App for Unmatched Intro Edits on Various Gadgets

According to statistics, videos grow much faster than other formats to grow your business. While this is encouraging news for video-using business owners, there is a catch: it will all be a waste of effort if viewers click away within the first few seconds. Remember this when you do an **editing intro**: a video intro can help or hinder your success.

As the most watched part of the video, it has the power to draw in your target audience, discourage viewers who aren't interested, and keep your ideal audience watching every time you publish. Thus, it needs to be catchy and memorable. How do you create a video intro that is compelling enough to bring people back for more? Below is a guide to creating video intros with the best **intro editor** apps for all your devices.
