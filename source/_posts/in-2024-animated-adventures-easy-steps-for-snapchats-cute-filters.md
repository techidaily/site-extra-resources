#### 4.Anime Style

Snapchat’s Anime Style takes its inspiration from the animation style that originated from the East. The Anime Style Lens gives you a makeover in an anime-style of animation and follows each of your expressions in real-time. The filter has a nice soft shading style that’s surprisingly artistic and looks almost like it’s been hand-drawn. Also, it’s fun to try making different expressions as they tend to transform your new anime self entirely.
