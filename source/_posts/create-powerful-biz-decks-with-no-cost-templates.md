## Part 4: Useful Business Slideshow Ideas to Wow Your Audience

Look at the few slideshow ideas and tips to amaze your audience.

#### 1. Divide into three

When creating your presentation slideshow, instead of introducing all the information, try to make it short by dividing the whole concept into three main topics. Then, complete the slideshow with simple effects and add animations.

#### 2. Make it a story

If you jump from one topic to another, not linked, then the ideas are challenging to understand. So, when you create a slideshow, make it a story then the idea will get conveyed just right.

#### 3. Use visuals

Instead of typing all the data in words, convert few important data into visuals like graphs and charts, using any of the business slideshow makers listed above. It will display the data pictorially, thus making it easy to understand.

#### 4. Highlight points

Slideshow created with the same text style and size may look a little boring. So, instead of using the same type throughout, highlight the critical points, like a hike in sales, etc., so that these points will well register to the clients.

#### 5. Music

While creating a video, music added to it will keep intact the audience so that they will not feel bored. You could use the same here; thus, it grabs the viewers' attention when adding business slideshow music.
