All MacOS system users need to pay attention here. Many people complain that the version of VLC that they downloaded off the internet is not functioning properly on their Mac. There is a reason behind its bleak performance.

The latest version of VLC media player is supported on the Mac OS X version. If you have this version then make sure to download the latest release. If not, do not despair because there is something for you too.

● For Mac OS X 10.3 Panther, the VLC 0.8.6i should be used.

● If you have Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar, only go for VLC 0.8.4a.

● Last but not least, users of Mac OS X 10.0 Cheetah and 10.1 Puma should install VLC 0.7.0.
