 This device is able to shoot videos with 4K rating and all the details are fine tuned with its 12.7 MP sensor. The burst shooting mode and exposure bracketing shooting options are added whereas the 3 axis type gimbal support makes camera more stable during air moves. This drone is good for indoor as well as outdoor in air shooting where gestures can be easily adjusted from software control buttons. The 4K videos can be switched between different frame rates as 960 fps on 1080p resolution and 30fps is available for 4k users.

#### App

![dji mavic review](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dji-go-app-screenshot.jpg)

 The feature rich DJI Go mobile application assists users in easy settings for all features. App is connected via Wi-Fi support and it offers so many intuitive controls up to wide range of movements. When your drone is in air, you can easily send all useful commands from your application and best part is that it is also possible to have live view of things happening in air via mobile application. The DJI support application is updated time to time with all new set of features.
