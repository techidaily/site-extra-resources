 Remember one thing that while you open the iPhone live photos app, the audio option is always switched on. So, whatever you speak, shout, or discuss will be clearly recorded in the video. Keep in mind that shouting at the top of your voice and asking a person to move so that you can click a great view or moving pictures on iPhone can spoil your live photos. So, beware.

## Conclusion

 The digital photography gets a completely new dimension through the iPhone live photos. Press the shutter button of your iOS devices and capture live pictures on iPhone.
