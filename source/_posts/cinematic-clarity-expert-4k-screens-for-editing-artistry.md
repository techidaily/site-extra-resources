Video editors always need high quality monitors so that they can clearly visualize the effects and changes after editing. It should display fine colours, crisp details and should reflect all components of frames with clear effect. [Colours](https://lifehacker.com/5784663/the-basics-of-video-editing-part-iii-effects-and-color-correction) play most important role in video editing and if they are not well managed on screen then it becomes much difficult for editors to make corrections. Although, market is currently loaded with so many color monitors but there are few selected ones that can meet professional requirements especially when it comes to 4K video.

For this reason, we have done some research about the monitors for 4k video editing and summarized the reason of using 4K monitor for video editing (especially for professional video editors), and 9 the best 4k monitors available now for 4k video editing.

### Benefits of Using 4K Monitors for Video Editing

Do you need a [4K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K%5Fresolution) monitor to edit 4K videos? Well, there are so many benefits of using professional 4K monitors for professional video editing needs. Here we are discussing top two advantages:

* It helps viewers to enjoy content on 1:1 scale and this is definitely an incredible experience.
* Secondly, it provides editors with lots of working space so that they can access multiple applications at a time. For an instance, take example of editing a video project on Final Cut Pro; 4K monitors allow you to interact easily on timeline without wasting time on scrolling so that you can process things faster while ensuring high quality results.

### Things Need to Know Before Buying a 4K Monitor for Video Editing

You will find unlimited monitor designs in market but it is important to check few major specifications while buying a new one for your 4K video editing needs. It should match the resolution standards. There are generally two major terms that we follow in this category:

* First one is DCI 4K that deals with 4096x2160 pixels while maintaining 256:135 aspect ratio. This is the most commonly followed standard in film industry.
* Second is UHD-1 that we often call as 4K for TV productions. It delivers 3840x2160 resolution level with 16:9 aspect ratio.

Most of the cameras these days are designed with UHD 4K abilities because it brings impressive results for YouTube posts. When these videos are accessed on 16:9 screen, there are no black bars on top or bottom portion of the screen.
