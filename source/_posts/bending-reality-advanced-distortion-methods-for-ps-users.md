## How to Create Distortion Effects in Photoshop

### How to Apply Glitch Effects in Photoshop

A glitch effect creates a visible result of being a little unusual in its look. It is one of the most common trends in digital craft, and making it is not as difficult as it seems. You can transform ordinary photos into stunning digital artwork with the appropriate effects and filters. This guide will teach you how to do it using Photoshop.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Step 1\

You will first need to import an image into Photoshop. Double-click on the Background layer and make it a New Layer.

Press Control-Shift-N to create a New Layer positioned below your reference. Then, set your Foreground Color to white, then use the Paint Bucket Tool to fill the layer with white.

### Step 2\

Now, select the Magnetic Lasso Tool, as this will allow you to extract the reference by snapping to the sides of the model. Create an entire selection around the model using the Magnetic Lasso Tool.

Once you are done, Right-click and then select Layer through Copy; this will allow you to create a duplicate quickly.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![how to apply glitch effects in photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/photoshop-distortion-effects-1.png)

### Step 3\

Select your original stock, and press Control-T to use the Free Transform Tool to bring in the background sides to expose a bit of the white to the right and left.

If your photo does not have a background, you could also use the Rectangle Tool to add a rectangle.

### Step 4\

You can desaturate your picture for a monochromatic color palette. Next, select the layer for the cutout of the model and head to Image > Adjustments, then choose the Hue & Saturation option. Remove the majority of the picture's color by lowering the Saturation up to 95.

![how to apply glitch effects in photoshop - choose hue & saturation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/photoshop-distortion-effects-2.png)

You can use Levels to adjust the main picture further. Select the extracted model's layer and navigate to Image>Adjustments; then select Levels and make adjustments for the RGB Channel by inserting the following settings:

* Output Levels: 17, 255
* Highlight Input Level: 255
* Midtone Input Level: 0.92
* Midtone Input Level: 0.92

The result will be subtle, and it'll slightly lighten the model.

![how to apply glitch effects in photoshop - result](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/photoshop-distortion-effects-3.png)

### Step 5\

The next step of this glitch effect is recreating the jagged photo distortion to make the visuals look as if they are out of place. You can do this by selecting the model and stock layers and merging them.

![how to apply glitch effects in photoshop - recreate jagged photo distortion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/photoshop-distortion-effects-4.png)

### Step 6\

Select the Rectangular Marquee Tool, and create two skinny selections on your photo layer. You can start by creating one selection at the bottom. Then, add another one at the top by holding the Shift key.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![how to apply glitch effects in photoshop - using Rectangular Marquee tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/photoshop-distortion-effects-5.png)

Change to the Move Tool by pressing the V key. Use the Arrow key on your keyboard to move selections to the left-hand side. Hold it down for some time or hit it several times to get the desired result.

### Step 7\

You can continue the process on a single layer; however, you'll eventually see open white spaces that do not look good. Therefore, to avoid this, you might want to Duplicate the Model Layer and then create the distortion using the copy.

Again, create more selections using the Rectangular Marquee Tool; use the Right and Left Arrow keys to move them in different directions.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Step 8\

Use the Move Tool to create even more Rectangular Selections and move the various sections out of place. Make the effect more natural by varying the size between thicker selections and skinny ones.

Do not distort the face too much; you can do each glitch separately to see what will work.

### Step 5\

The next step of this glitch effect is recreating the jagged photo distortion to make the visuals look as if they are out of place. You can do this by selecting the model and stock layers and merging them.

![how to apply glitch effects in photoshop - recreate jagged photo distortion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/photoshop-distortion-effects-4.png)

### Step 6\

Select the Rectangular Marquee Tool, and create two skinny selections on your photo layer. You can start by creating one selection at the bottom. Then, add another one at the top by holding the Shift key.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Step 7\

You can continue the process on a single layer; however, you'll eventually see open white spaces that do not look good. Therefore, to avoid this, you might want to Duplicate the Model Layer and then create the distortion using the copy.

Again, create more selections using the Rectangular Marquee Tool; use the Right and Left Arrow keys to move them in different directions.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Step 2

Enter the word Glitch using the Type tool. A simple sans-serif typeface will work well for this effect. For instance, you can use Montserrat at 480px and 140 letter spacing.

### Step 3

Next, right-click the text layer and select Convert to Smart Object.

![how to apply glitch text effects in photoshop - Convert to smart object](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/photoshop-distortion-effects-7.png)

### Step 4

![how to apply glitch text effects in photoshop - group three smart object layers=](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/photoshop-distortion-effects-10.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Step 3\

Select your original stock, and press Control-T to use the Free Transform Tool to bring in the background sides to expose a bit of the white to the right and left.

If your photo does not have a background, you could also use the Rectangle Tool to add a rectangle.

### Step 4\

You can desaturate your picture for a monochromatic color palette. Next, select the layer for the cutout of the model and head to Image > Adjustments, then choose the Hue & Saturation option. Remove the majority of the picture's color by lowering the Saturation up to 95.

![how to apply glitch effects in photoshop - choose hue & saturation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/photoshop-distortion-effects-2.png)

You can use Levels to adjust the main picture further. Select the extracted model's layer and navigate to Image>Adjustments; then select Levels and make adjustments for the RGB Channel by inserting the following settings:

* Output Levels: 17, 255
* Highlight Input Level: 255
* Midtone Input Level: 0.92
* Midtone Input Level: 0.92

The result will be subtle, and it'll slightly lighten the model.

## How to Create Distortion Effects in Photoshop

The glitch effect is a digital effect that randomly corrupts image data. You can use the glitch effect on both text and images; this is one of the coolest effects you can create in Photoshop.

### How to Apply Glitch Effects in Photoshop

A glitch effect creates a visible result of being a little unusual in its look. It is one of the most common trends in digital craft, and making it is not as difficult as it seems. You can transform ordinary photos into stunning digital artwork with the appropriate effects and filters. This guide will teach you how to do it using Photoshop.

### Step 1\

You will first need to import an image into Photoshop. Double-click on the Background layer and make it a New Layer.

Press Control-Shift-N to create a New Layer positioned below your reference. Then, set your Foreground Color to white, then use the Paint Bucket Tool to fill the layer with white.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://natural-cycles.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072199/17885" target="_top" id="2072199"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17885-2072199" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="300"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072199/17885" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Step 2\

Now, select the Magnetic Lasso Tool, as this will allow you to extract the reference by snapping to the sides of the model. Create an entire selection around the model using the Magnetic Lasso Tool.

Once you are done, Right-click and then select Layer through Copy; this will allow you to create a duplicate quickly.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Step 3\

Select your original stock, and press Control-T to use the Free Transform Tool to bring in the background sides to expose a bit of the white to the right and left.

If your photo does not have a background, you could also use the Rectangle Tool to add a rectangle.

### Step 4\

You can desaturate your picture for a monochromatic color palette. Next, select the layer for the cutout of the model and head to Image > Adjustments, then choose the Hue & Saturation option. Remove the majority of the picture's color by lowering the Saturation up to 95.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![how to apply glitch effects in photoshop - choose hue & saturation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/photoshop-distortion-effects-2.png)

You can use Levels to adjust the main picture further. Select the extracted model's layer and navigate to Image>Adjustments; then select Levels and make adjustments for the RGB Channel by inserting the following settings:

* Output Levels: 17, 255
* Highlight Input Level: 255
* Midtone Input Level: 0.92
* Midtone Input Level: 0.92

The result will be subtle, and it'll slightly lighten the model.

### Step 5\

The next step of this glitch effect is recreating the jagged photo distortion to make the visuals look as if they are out of place. You can do this by selecting the model and stock layers and merging them.

![how to apply glitch effects in photoshop - recreate jagged photo distortion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/photoshop-distortion-effects-4.png)

### Step 6\

Select the Rectangular Marquee Tool, and create two skinny selections on your photo layer. You can start by creating one selection at the bottom. Then, add another one at the top by holding the Shift key.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1095219&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-20_%281%29.jpg" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![how to apply glitch effects in photoshop - using Rectangular Marquee tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/photoshop-distortion-effects-5.png)

Change to the Move Tool by pressing the V key. Use the Arrow key on your keyboard to move selections to the left-hand side. Hold it down for some time or hit it several times to get the desired result.

### Step 7\

You can continue the process on a single layer; however, you'll eventually see open white spaces that do not look good. Therefore, to avoid this, you might want to Duplicate the Model Layer and then create the distortion using the copy.

Again, create more selections using the Rectangular Marquee Tool; use the Right and Left Arrow keys to move them in different directions.

### Step 8\

Use the Move Tool to create even more Rectangular Selections and move the various sections out of place. Make the effect more natural by varying the size between thicker selections and skinny ones.

Do not distort the face too much; you can do each glitch separately to see what will work.
