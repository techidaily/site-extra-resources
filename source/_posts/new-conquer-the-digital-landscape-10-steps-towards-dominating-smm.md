## What is social media marketing (SMM)?

Social media marketing (SMM) typically refers to the use of online communities, social networks, and Internet media collaboration platforms to achieve marketing conversion through various methods, such as media promotion, attracting new users, and maintaining customer relationships.

Social media marketing, a key battleground for new media marketing, has also provided new impetus to companies involved in traditional marketing and a boost in marketing behavior.

So, how does a successful social media marketing campaign get planned and executed? Take a look at the ten ideas below.

**1\. Design Your Strategies**

You need to follow several steps to become a successful SMM. First, define your goals and objectives. Doing this will determine what kind of content you need and if it is likely to help you reach your goals.

After defining your goals and objectives, brainstorm some ideas for content that aligns with these objectives. Then set a schedule for creating this content so it can be published on time—and ensure it's consistent!

Next up: define your target audience so that every piece of content resonates with this audience—it should also be aligned with their values/beliefs/needs/desires (whatever they may be).

Once these things are decided, develop strategies for each social media platform based on the type of information shared (i.e., text vs. photo vs. gif vs. video).

**2\. Starting Live Broadcast**

Because it allows you to connect with your audience in real time, live streaming is one of the most popular social media marketing tools. It will allow them to interact with you and become involved in your business.

If done, live streaming can be a good way to increase brand awareness, build trust and improve customer service for your target audience.

What You'll Need:

* A camera or phone that supports live streaming (or a laptop) - You can use any device with a camera built-in or connected via a USB cable (webcam). A phone will work, too, if it supports live streaming through its camera app.
* When using a laptop, ensure there's no glare from windows or lights behind you; otherwise, this could mess up how well people can see what's happening on screen when watching via computer/laptop screen-sharing software such as Skype or Beamr (see below).

**3\. Social Media Influencer**

Social media influencer is a term used to describe a person who significantly impacts consumers' purchasing decisions.

Influencers can be celebrities and well-known public figures, but they can also be regular people with large followers and engagement on social media.

Influencers can be paid or unpaid, but most receive compensation for their posts/content.

**4\. Create Subscription Options**

Subscription options are one of the best features of social media marketing. People who subscribe to your channel will be notified via email about all new posts you make on that channel. The subscriber can then choose to accept or decline the notification.

To create a subscription option:

* Navigate to "Customize" on the top right corner of your page and select "Subscription Options" from the dropdown menu.
* Enter your desired name and description, then click "Save Changes" at the bottom of this section
* To set up a subscription:

**5\. Engage with your Audience**

Engaging with your audience is a great way to keep them coming back and to ensure that your content is relevant. Here are some ways you can engage with your audience:

* Respond to comments in real-time. Responding to comments on social media is a great way to get immediate feedback from your community, show them that they're being heard, and start discussions around topics they care about.
* Answer questions in the comments section of your posts or videos.
* Ask for feedback on new products or services you are launching. This can be as simple as asking what customers want you to create next!

**6\. Create User Generated Content**

It's important to remember that social media is about the community, so it's important to encourage your audience members to create content.

If you're not getting user-generated content (UGC) on your website or blog, you're losing out on a lot of potential traffic and engagement. Luckily, there are plenty of ways you can make sure that UGC happens:

* Encourage your followers to share images that relate to your brand or products using hashtags such as #yourbrandname and #yourproductsname. This will help people find those posts later when searching for related content.
* If someone posts something valuable on your platforms (Twitter, Instagram), comment and thank them for their contribution! It shows appreciation for their time and effort in creating something useful for others.

**7\. Create a Positive Brand Image**

Create a positive brand image. The first thing you want to do is create a positive brand image for yourself and your company. This will help you stand out from the competition and set yourself up for success in all areas of social marketing, especially on social media, where people constantly look for new products or services to try out.

Use the right words and images. The best way to convey this is through your website's design, which should be clean, easy to navigate (especially on mobile), simple in style, but modern enough that it looks good with everything else being made today.

It's a good idea to choose a domain name that matches your business name precisely, so there's no confusion when people visit it online. Or you could go for something generic but memorable like.

**8\. Create a Content Plan for your Brand**

The first step in creating a successful SMM strategy is to create a content plan. You can create a content calendar to help you stay on track and be more efficient in your efforts.

Content planning is important for SMM because it will help you stay focused on what needs to be done, how much time each task takes, and who should do it. The result of having a sound content plan will be an increase in productivity and efficiency while also allowing you to stay on track with your goals.

**9\. Keep an Eye on Competition and Trends**

Monitor your competitors and be aware of what is happening in the industry. Take advantage of social media to keep up with industry trends and find out what your audience is interested in. Social media can also help you determine what your competition is doing.

**10\. Participate in Social Media Events**

Social media events can be a great way to get your name out there and promote your brand.

* They are a good way to get new leads.
* You can also use social media events to build your brand's reputation.

## BONUS: Just keep sending out a message

One of the most important things to remember is that consistency is the key. You need to be constantly promoting yourself, not just every so often. Don't just post a message once and assume that people will see it and buy from you because they won't!

Social media can be hard work sometimes but don't give up hope; if you keep trying, it will eventually pay off!
