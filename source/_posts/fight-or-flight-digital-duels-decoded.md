## Comparison between Twitch and Hitbox

When we talk about a streaming platform then user base matters a lot; hitbox offers great services but its community is 1/10th as that of Twitch and it causes restriction over growth. If you are a real streamer then you may need a platform that offers fast growth to your career but Hitbox demand more time from your side.

Hitbox also offers a lower entry level partnership program as compared to Twitch and its added benefits are somewhere same as that of Twitch platform such as monthly subscriptions, transcoding facilities and custom emotes.

On the other side, if we talk about technology then Hitbox is far better than Twitch because it supports HTML instead of working with flash like Twitch. Also, Hitbox does not demand IRC for its chat facility.

## Comparison between Twitch and Hitbox

When we talk about a streaming platform then user base matters a lot; hitbox offers great services but its community is 1/10th as that of Twitch and it causes restriction over growth. If you are a real streamer then you may need a platform that offers fast growth to your career but Hitbox demand more time from your side.

Hitbox also offers a lower entry level partnership program as compared to Twitch and its added benefits are somewhere same as that of Twitch platform such as monthly subscriptions, transcoding facilities and custom emotes.

On the other side, if we talk about technology then Hitbox is far better than Twitch because it supports HTML instead of working with flash like Twitch. Also, Hitbox does not demand IRC for its chat facility.
