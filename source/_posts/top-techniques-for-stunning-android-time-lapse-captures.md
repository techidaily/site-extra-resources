In other words, these videos’ frames are captured at a much lower rate than normal and when the video is played, it seems to be playing faster. For instance, you might have watched many videos where the clouds are running too fast or the sunset process is happening quickly or maybe traffic is pacing up too much.

## Part4: Differences between Hyper Lapse and Time Lapse

You have learnt almost everything about time-lapse videography. We also think you should know how hyper-lapse and time-lapse distinguishes from each other. These two techniques are not same. The technique of hyper-lapse video includes a moving camera in contrast with the time-lapse videos. It is part of time-lapse videography where the camera is moving at different angles and exposures. Keeping it simpler, a time-lapse video is made with keeping camera undisturbed whereas hyper-lapse videos involverecording the video while moving the camera.
