## Unveiling WhatsApp's Call Conversations

Hello guys, almost all of us are familiar with the name WhatsApp when it comes to some best and most popular messaging apps. There are numerous features available on WhatsApp. However, today we will discuss an essential topic regarding WhatsApp: **how you can send a voice message or recorded audio on WhatsApp**. This guide will briefly examine the methods of **sending voice messages** and **audio recording** over WhatsApp on iOS or Android.

## Part 1\. How to send a voice message on WhatsApp?

Now let's first look into how you can record and send a voice message on WhatsApp. We will discuss it from the perspective of both iOS and Android users.

### How to send the voice message on iOS or Android

The steps of recording and sending a voice message using WhatsApp are nearly identical on iOS and Android devices. So both iOS and Android users can follow up on these steps:

1. Press and hold the voice recorder button on the right side to record the voice message. However, a more effective way is to swipe up the voice recorder button to lock it. Now you can easily record it without holding the button.
2. There are three more options appear at the bottom:

* **The Delete button** can used to delete the voice you've just recorded. However, if you haven't locked the recorder button, you can delete the message by sliding it to the left.
* **The pause button** can help you in pausing the recording.
* **The send button** will send your recorded voice message.

1. Before sending, you can also check your recorded voice by clicking the pause button, and then you have the option to play the voice.
