## Top 8 Drawing Apps for iPhone You Should Try

The number of available brushes, layering options, or support for vector graphics are some of the most important features that can make the process of selecting a drawing app for the iPhone easier. Whether or not the drawing app supports a stylus pen can also be an important factor that may help you pick a drawing app. So, without further ado, here are some of the best drawing apps for iPhone.

### 1. Adobe Photoshop Sketch

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

Like all other Adobe’s products, Adobe Photoshop Sketch is capable of great performances. The app is equipped with the famous Adobe’s brush engine and it features 24 built-in brushes. You can customize the size, opacity, blending options, or color for each brush you pick, while you can also import brushes from Photoshop.

The app doesn’t limit the number of layers you can create and it lets you combine photo and drawing layers to create unique designs. In addition, Adobe Photoshop Sketch lets you use perspective and graph grids that assist you with the composition of your drawings. The app is compatible with Apple Pencil which gives you more precision while you are working on demanding projects. Each image you create with Adobe Photoshop Sketch can be printed in 8K or lower resolutions.

However, Adobe Photoshop Sketch was discontinued for iOS and Android and are no longer available for download, from July 19th, 2021\. You can have a look at the following apps.

A brief look at the Procreate Pocket’s list of features will make you wonder if there is anything this drawing app cannot do.

It also supports third-party styluses which makes drawing or painting feel more natural.

The app is equipped with 3D Touch technology designed for pressure-sensitive painting, while its Silica M painting engine eliminates lagging. Procreate Pocket has an advanced layer system that includes clipping and layer masks that enable non-destructive editing.

![iColorama S photo editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/icolorama-s-photo-editor-brush-painter.jpg)

Although iColorama S is primarily a photo editing app, you can still use it to create digital paintings and drawings. Its impressive selection of brushes grants you the creative freedom you need to turn your ideas into pieces of art. Importing Adobe Photoshop brushes into the app is also an option if you want to have the versatility the brushes in this iconic photo editing software offer.

There are over three hundred effects to choose from and each of them can be applied to a photo in just a few taps. Moreover, all effects are fully customizable so that you can choose their intensity or adjust other settings. Despite being a [well-rounded photo editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and brush painter iColorama S lacks some essential features other drawing apps for iPhones offer.

### 7. [Autodesk SketchBook](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/autodesk-sketchbook/id883738213)

**Price:** Free

Autodesk SketchBook is compatible with the second generation of the Apple Pencil and it supports the double-tap functionality. Currently, you cannot scan sketches from an iPhone.

### 8. [Clip Studio Paint for iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clip-studio-paint-for-iphone/id1483037022)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

![Clip Studio Paint for iPhone ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clip-studio-paint-for-iphone-draw-paint-app.jpg)

Creating a digital drawing or painting with Clip Studio Paint is a fun and intuitive process as this feature-packed app offers everything you need to produce stunning images. You can choose from a broad spectrum of brushes and pens, and pick an airbrush, oil, or watercolor paint style. The app stabilization and correction features help you draw lines as you intended them to be which reduces the need to use the eraser tool.

You can import photos into Clip Studio Paint and paint over them or use the Pose Scanner feature to create automatic poses. However, creating high-resolution images with Clip Studio Paint on older versions of the iPhone may be difficult and you must have iPhone Pro Max or some similar model in order to produce artwork in high resolutions. The free version of the app has time limitations, and you must purchase one of the available subscription models in order to use Clip Studio Paint without any restrictions.

**Conclusion**

We don’t always have time to be creative, but having a drawing app on your iPhone is going to enable you to use the free time you have more creatively. Drawing apps for iPhones are aimed at both professionals and enthusiasts who like to pass their time by doing something creative.
