Step1 First, download its latest version. Next, launch the software, and click **“Import”** on the main dashboard to add two songs to make a custom ringtone for your iPhone.

Step2 Drag the songs to the **“Timeline Panel”** at the bottom. Then, right-click only that song whose silent parts you want to eliminate.

Step3 Now, a **“Silence Detection”** window will open up in which you can change three parameters, **“Threshold,” “Minimum Silence,” and “Buffer,”** by moving the slider**.** Afterward, you can click **“Start”** to roll automatic silence detection, eliminating all the file's silent parts.

Step4 In this step, emphasize one song over the other. For this, right-click a particular song in the **“Timeline Panel”** and select **“Adjust Audio.”** Now, check the **“Audio Ducking”** feature and click **“OK”** to make changes to the song.

**_P.S.:_** Audio Ducking can automatically lower the volume of one track to make another track clearer when you're recording voiceovers, narrations, translations, podcasts, YouTube videos, and other productions that benefit from lowering background music under speech.

Step5 Next, trim the file to reduce its length. For this, click on the file, and a double arrow will appear. Drag the double arrow to select a part that you want to trim. Then, click the **“Split”** option to remove this part.

Step6 In the last step, click the **“Create”** option and hit the **“Export”** button to save the file on your PC. Finally, transfer the file to your iPhone using a USB cable, and you’re done!
