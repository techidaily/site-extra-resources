It can be purchased for under $300 and has professional features including first person view, compatibility with GoPro HERO3, HERO3+ and HERO4 and you can purchase a 3-axis gimbal to keep the camera stable while it is in flight as well as allowing you to take pictures and videos easily.

Footage can be saved directly to your phone and you can get rid of unwanted footage in flight making it easier to store the parts you want to and make later editing easier. You can easily operate the drone in its automated modes so that the drone can follow pre-decided routes or follow you. This clever drone even includes a simulator for you to practice before using your drone which is great for those that want to perfect their flying skills. The battery lasts for up to 20 minutes of in-flight action per charge and to keep track there is a battery status so you don't run out in the middle of the flight.
