## Hardware Comparison

#### Design

#### Accessories

 Second noticeable difference is in accessories of both action cam units.

## Features and Performance Comparison

The image quality with such interpolated system goes really bad. But if you compare performance of both devices at Full HD 1080p resolution level then you will be able to find impressive quality with Yi cam and it also provides support to 120fps frame rate at 1080p.
