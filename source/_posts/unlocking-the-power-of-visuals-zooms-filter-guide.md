Zoom is the most popular app for remote communication digitally. Starting from taking online classes to organizing online meetings, Zoom is the most preferred platform. There are several reasons for the popularity of Zoom such as easy to setup and join meetings, access from any device, instant chatting integration, and easy screen sharing option.

There are certain features where Zoom outshines its competitors, and they are the use of virtual background and video filters.
