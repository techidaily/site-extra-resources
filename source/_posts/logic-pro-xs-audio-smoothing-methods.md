## Logic Pro X's Audio Smoothing Methods

Being a top-notch editor, youâ€™d anticipate the cross-fade Logic Pro to perform at its highest level as Logic has added more and more features. Music industry experts may create and edit dynamic audio tracks utilizing step-sequencing, multi-device editing, and live looping features with the help of the Logic Pro crossfades and full audio editing features it offers. Modern synthesizers, retro gear, and intricate multi-sampled instruments are just a few of the plugins and sounds that are included with Logic Pro X.

One of Apple's hidden crown jewels for a number of years now has been the music creation program Logic Pro X. Logic Pro keeps becoming better and better. Fades make it easier to segue between different parts of a composition or between different track components. Audio and MIDI zones in the workspace may be faded in or out in a number of ways in Logic Pro X. Find out the detailed steps to Logic Pro crossfade in the upcoming sections.

## Part 1\. Steps to Crossfade Audio in Logic Pro X

Users of any iOS device may control audio filters, mix multiple tracks, and play built-in software instruments using the Logic Remote feature. The fastest method to do a fade in or fade out is to use the fade tool on a loop, sample, recording, or whole track. The fade tool can currently only be used with audio regions, however utilizing this technique, a fade may be swiftly created in only a few seconds.

##### Step1 Create two tracks

Your audio files should be imported into two new stereo Audio Tracks that you create in the Arrange section.

##### Step2 Connect Two Audio Regions

On the grid, place two audio areas next to one another. Crossfading may be used with two entirely different audio regions or a duplication of a single audio region.

##### Step3 Choose the Fade Tool

You will choose every region on a track when you browse to it in the track header section. If the music contains numerous regions, you should choose the first area to deal with as executing a cross-fade requires you to first pick the regions you'd want to have the fade effect. Select the Fade Tool from the drop-down option for the Left-Click Tool.

##### Step4 Create a crossfade

Although it works as intended, moving the volume fader on one of the channel strips to switch between two recordings is not really enjoyable. Let's make the crossfader larger.
