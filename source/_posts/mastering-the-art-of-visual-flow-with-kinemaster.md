##### Step1 Launch Kinemaster

Using your Android or iOS device, you can easily download the software from the App Store. Then launch it; from the main interface, add your video clips/media files either from Media Browser or click the (+) symbol for the media files.

##### Step2 Open up the transition

Once video clips get uploaded, you will see the videos at the interface bottom area. Here, in between the clips, you will find the transition gap(menu). You need to click on it to view all the available transitions.

Note - If there is only one video uploaded, split the video to add the required transition.
