“Just load your JPG in the input area, adjust a couple of options, and you'll instantly see the modified GIF in the output area. Click save-as to download the new GIF file and you're done.” A user from a GIF forum

In brief, when you need GIF transparent files along with regular ones, try this online tool. There are no hassles of selecting multiple options while using the tool as once the file is added, it will automatically convert it to the desired format.

## Part 2\. Best Solution to Convert JPG to GIF on Windows/Mac

Above we have listed several online tools that can work directly from a browser. Though simple and free to use, these programs are internet-dependent and have file size restrictions, and other limitations.
