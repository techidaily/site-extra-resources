People use it as a form of effector to share their perspectives. You can distort pic for various reasons. They include:

#### 1\. Allows You to Have Fun

* Under-Exposure: This is when the person in the photo is too dark or under-exposed to show the subject's features.
* Visual Stretching is when you digitally stretch an image to the desired size, sometimes using a "zoom" feature to get closer or broader shots of the subject.
