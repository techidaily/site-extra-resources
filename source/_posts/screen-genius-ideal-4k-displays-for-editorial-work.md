It should display fine colours, crisp details and should reflect all components of frames with clear effect. [Colours](https://lifehacker.com/5784663/the-basics-of-video-editing-part-iii-effects-and-color-correction) play most important role in video editing and if they are not well managed on screen then it becomes much difficult for editors to make corrections. Although, market is currently loaded with so many color monitors but there are few selected ones that can meet professional requirements especially when it comes to 4K video.

### Benefits of Using 4K Monitors for Video Editing

Do you need a [4K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K%5Fresolution) monitor to edit 4K videos? Well, there are so many benefits of using professional 4K monitors for professional video editing needs. Here we are discussing top two advantages:

* It helps viewers to enjoy content on 1:1 scale and this is definitely an incredible experience.

* Second is UHD-1 that we often call as 4K for TV productions. It delivers 3840x2160 resolution level with 16:9 aspect ratio.
