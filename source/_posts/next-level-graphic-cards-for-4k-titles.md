 The gaming world is fast evolving in line with every gamers crave for a better gaming experience. As a matter of fact, there is a new technology in town i.e the 4k resolution also called Ultra HD which has entered the gaming world. The 4k resolution is supported by graphic cards which are not just up to date but also designed for this technology.

 Well, 4k resolution can be achieved by the use of good graphics card which we will look at later in depth. These graphic cards are expensive although there are surely others that are relatively cheap. Some gamers have even opted to use double graphic cards in a bid to try to achieve this resolution. This may work although in other instances it has failed to work as it is incompatible with machines that do not to support multiple cards. So if you are looking for the best graphic cards for 4K gaming then we have compiled a great list for you!

### Conclusion

 The gaming industry has been moving with the times allowing better resolution, faster games and achieving a virtual reality in HD as well as in 3D. With the graphics we have looked at we have been able to establish that this technology is driven by price, performance and the ability of the computer being used.

 From more expensive GPU to the budget ones we have to establish that users are interested in a better resolution that can achieve virtual reality with speed. Users are also interested in GPU devices that don't overheat as well as well as those that are compatible with the computer they plan to use. This technology will always be changing with the times so it is important to always buy one that gives value for money, versatile and bound to work for long.

* This GPU has a very high bandwidth cache allowing less queuing time for processes ie no need to squeeze polygons, shaders, and texts to the VRAMS in the card. This also reduces the usage of the computer processor hence increasing performance.
* Concurrency of processes that are non-uniform in terms of graphics is allowed. This is possible as this GPU allows itself to do smaller processes while it isn't busy. This also reduces idle time.

 **Cons**

* This processor is said to be using alt of power during the processes
* It is very expensive retailing @ 999-1499

#### 4.**GeForce GTX 1080 Founders Edition Graphics Card**

 This GPU is owned by NVIDIA and is made on a Pascal architecture. This has enabled better performance through increased memory band width and power efficiency. It also has a good cooling technology thus reduces on overheating. Some of the features include;

 **Pros**

* VR works graphics work to improve the 4k resolution. This allows the virtual world around the user to be as real as possible e.g explosion in a game looks as real as possible.
* Scalable link interface(SLI) can allow a user to combine two GPUs in the same machine and allow them to concurrently share processes. This makes processes more efficient
* The NVIDIA GPU Boost 3.0 is part of the feature that allows you to increase clock speed to improve performance as well as tilt during intense high-resolution gaming to reduce overheating

 **Cons**

* Expensive to purchase retailing @ $699
* There are cases of overheating in heavy usage
* This GPU features 4gb high bandwidth memory. Its ability to support 4k resolution comfortably lies in its cooling technology which is a liquid that is looped over and over.

#### 5.**AMD Radeon R9 Fury X**

 This GPU card features 4Gb high band width memory. Its ability to support 4K resolution lies in its cooling technology which is liquid cooled that is looped over and over.

 **Pros**

* This radiator like cooling system allows it to be smaller, less noisy and has the ability to handle high-resolution processes comfortably.
* It features the free sync technology that allows the graph card and monitor to communicate hence adjusting the monitors refresh rate to the frame rate being displayed by the graph. This increases efficiency
* It allows the desktop to have multiple screen display improving the gaming experience
* It also has a frame rate target control that allows you select the frames the game is going to need making the gaming smoother
* This GPU is compatible with the mother boards that allows multiple GPUS Installed allowing them to share processes hence increasing resolution
* It has zero core power technology that shuts down the GPU during idle time

 **Cons**

* Expensive to purchase retailing at @ $679
* Uses a lot of power

## **Budget Options– Graphic Cards for 4k Gaming**

#### 1.**GeForce GTX 980 Ti**

 This GPU is pocket-friendly and can still give you a 4k resolution for your gaming experience. It is known for its cooling ability during processes. this is made possible by the cold plate and pump design allowing lower temperatures.

 **Pros**

* Relatively Cheaper to buy @ 500
* Good cooling system
* Supported by many computers

 **Cons**

* Overheats quickly
* Doesn't support a lot of 4k games

#### 2.**NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX 1070**

 This Pascal architecture GPU is known for its improved performance, memory band width, and power efficiency. This GPU supports 4k resolution.

 **Pros**

* It's cooling technology allows less use of power with the use of double fans that is curved to use air flow and less power
* VRworks is included in the graphics to allow both audio and video clarity
* The scalable link interface(SLI) allows processes to be taken concurrently in this GPU

 **Cons**

* Overheats under very intense cases
* Doesn't support a lot of 4K resolution games

#### 3.**AMD Radeon RX 480**

 This GPU is a pocket-friendly one that runs 4k resolution but with no fancy technology

 **Pros**

* It is cheap @ $489
* Good performance within the budget range

 **Cons**

* Noisy during usage
* Doesn't support a lot of 4k resolution games

#### 4.**AMD RADEON RX 570**

 This GPU is quite good for a budget client being the cheapest in the range. It is based on Polaris architecture with overclocking core.

 **Pros**

* It is known to be a high dynamic range content meaning the contrast in colors always come out with a high resolution
* It has a double fan that ensures cooling is well taken care of
* It has a free sync technology that allows it to adjust the refresh rate to that of the frame rate being outputted by the graphic card this reduces screen tearing and stuttering.
* The cross fire allows the same GPU be installed and the processes be split hence increasing efficiency and resolution
* It is the cheapest retailing @ $ 289

 **Cons**

* It can overheat quickly
* Doesn't support a lot of 4k games in the market

#### 5.**AMD RADEON RX 580**

 This GPU is budget friendly as well as effective in its working.

 **Pros**

* It has a stream processor that allows parallel computing tasks hence taking some processes load off the CPU
* It has many outputs allowing up to 4 monitors to use this GPU at a time
* It has a good cooling system reducing on overheating

* It is cheap retailing @$399

 **Cons**

* It doesn't support a lot of 4k gaming

### Conclusion

 The gaming industry has been moving with the times allowing better resolution, faster games and achieving a virtual reality in HD as well as in 3D. With the graphics we have looked at we have been able to establish that this technology is driven by price, performance and the ability of the computer being used.

 From more expensive GPU to the budget ones we have to establish that users are interested in a better resolution that can achieve virtual reality with speed. Users are also interested in GPU devices that don't overheat as well as well as those that are compatible with the computer they plan to use. This technology will always be changing with the times so it is important to always buy one that gives value for money, versatile and bound to work for long.

 The gaming world is fast evolving in line with every gamers crave for a better gaming experience. As a matter of fact, there is a new technology in town i.e the 4k resolution also called Ultra HD which has entered the gaming world. The 4k resolution is supported by graphic cards which are not just up to date but also designed for this technology.

 Well, 4k resolution can be achieved by the use of good graphics card which we will look at later in depth. These graphic cards are expensive although there are surely others that are relatively cheap. Some gamers have even opted to use double graphic cards in a bid to try to achieve this resolution. This may work although in other instances it has failed to work as it is incompatible with machines that do not to support multiple cards. So if you are looking for the best graphic cards for 4K gaming then we have compiled a great list for you!
