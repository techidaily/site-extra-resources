This amazing iPhone GIF maker lets you create a collection of memes and GIFs on its camera roll, and it is incredibly easy to use. The app's GIF camera enables you to record frame by frame or 12-second videos, while you can also add amusing captions, apply visual effects or adjust the GIF's playback speed. If you'd like to make a GIF from the footage that already exists you can easily import it into the GiF Forge and play with it in any way you want. In addition, this iPhone GIF maker lets you share GIFs to any social media network you can think of.

The Video to GIF app is free, but if you want to remove ads, you must make an in-app purchase. Ads are probably the only thing you won't like about this iPhone GIF maker since it allows its users to make a GIF from virtually anything. YouTube video, your own content or Live Photos can all be used to create brilliant GIFs. The app also allows you to use animated text in your GIFs, which is a great option if you want to create GIFs that will draw a lot of attention. The users of this GIF app for iPhone can get an URL and share their creations wherever they want.

#### 8\. GIF X

Even though the free version of this GIF app for iPhone provides more than enough features to create awesome GIFs, removing the watermark or unlocking all features must be paid for. GIF X provides over 300 effects that can be applied to videos and photos and more than 200 masks that can be used to customize GIF effects. Adding music to GIFs is another remarkable feature offered by the GIF X app, but you must import the photos and videos from your camera roll or download them from GIPHY.

#### 9\. GifLab

As its name suggests this iPhone GIF maker is a genuine laboratory that enables its users to create funny selfies or good old-fashioned GIFs. Each GIF created with GifLab can be converted to video and shared on Instagram or easily shared anywhere else on the Internet. This GIF app for iPhone lets you add captions, apply filters and choose the speed and the quality of a GIF, but it doesn't provide any tools for capturing photos or videos. Furthermore, GifLab is the only entry on this list that cannot be downloaded for free.

#### 10\. PicsArt GIF & Sticker Maker

Its users can use any kind of media to create their GIFs and what's more PicsArt GIF & Sticker Maker offers a long list of GIF effects and animated masks. The in-app camera allows you to record videos or take photos in burst mode while downloading content from Giphy is also an option. The huge library of fonts makes adding text or captions to GIFs a lot of fun and it contributes to a strong impression this app leaves on all of its users.

### Frequently Asked Questions About GIF Apps for iPhone

#### 1\. Can I Make Animated GIFs With iPhoneâ€™s Photos App?

Even though the Live Photos feature that is available in the iPhoneâ€™s native Photos app enables you to create image loops, you wonâ€™t be able to create a real GIF on iPhone without a GIF creator.

Luckily there are a lot of apps in the App Store you can use for free that allows you to create animated GIFs. Whatâ€™s more, you can use these apps to convert live photos youâ€™ve taken with your iPhone into GIFs and share them on non-Apple devices.

#### 2\. How to Turn Photos Into Animated Gifs on iPhone?

The only way to turn a series of photos into an animated GIF on the iPhone is to install a GIF creator app. Once youâ€™ve gone through the installation process, you just have to upload the photos you want to include in the GIF, add text or apply visual effects and set the loop count value.

The export options vary from one GIF app to the other, but most GIF creators that are compatible with iOS devices allow you to choose the quality of the GIF youâ€™re exporting or allow you to save your GIFs as videos.
