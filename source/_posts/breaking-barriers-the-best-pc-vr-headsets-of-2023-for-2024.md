### [Microsoft HoloLens](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Because of this technology it makes the virtual reality to be more real.

### [META 2](https://www.metavision.com/)

Meta was released in 2013 for augmented reality but now Meta 2 is the real invention that has caught eyes on. It looks like a replica of HoloLens, a largely shaped design like a helmet.
