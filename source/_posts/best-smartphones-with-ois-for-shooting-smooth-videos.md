### 6\. [Oppo Find X3 Pro](https://www.oppo.com/en/smartphones/series-find-x/find-x3-pro/)

Oppo's March 2021 flagship takes a drastically different approach than its predecessor when it comes to the camera arrangement. It is available on the market for $996.88.

### 9\. iPhone 12 Pro Max

The largest and most opulent of Apple's 2020 iPhones, the 12 Pro Max, looks to have a similar three-sensor layout to its predecessor, but it claims a slew of extra innovations, including a sector first. Released on October 11, 2020, it has a starting price of $999.

Since the announcement of the iPhone 12 Pro Max, the sensor-shift OIS (optical image stabilization) technology has been the camera's most talked-about feature. It has helped to improve Apple's already excellent night mode photography, resulting in even less noise and crisper pictures than before.

The three 12Mp sensors (a primary, 120Â° ultra-wide, and 2.5x optical zoom telephoto) shot with a satisfying uniformity and assurance that competing camera phones don't have.

### 10\. [Xiaomi Mi Note 10](https://www.mi.com/global/mi-note-10/)

The optics are the major focus of the Mi Note 10, with the phone receiving a 108-megapixel sensor as the main structure, which has a 1/1.33-inch sensor and OIS. The second sensor is a 13-megapixel ultra-wide lens with a 123-degree field of view, which sits beside a 2-megapixel macro camera and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. Moreover, it was launched on February 13, 2020, and has a starting price of $425.

## Part 2: What's the difference between AIS, OIS, and EIS?

The majority of people prefer OIS to EIS and AIS. A hardware method is usually superior to a software platform since EIS is simply a repair solution that causes image resolution deterioration by cutting it and predicting what it would look like if it were constant.

Because Huawei just recently introduced AIS, most people are unaware of it. However, you'll understand the difference after reading the following:

### **AI Image Stabilization (AIS)**

AIS is an image stabilization technique driven by AI that enables the camera to record long exposure films or pictures, particularly in low light circumstances, while preserving a clear and detailed image free of blur.

### **Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS)**

EIS is an image stabilization technology that examines the picture of about two-thirds of the camera sensor and then uses the images at the borders to adjust for camera motions. This is the strategy used by the vast majority of cameras.

**Conclusion**

Since you don't always have a camera to capture smooth videos, having an OIS camera phone is the need of the hour. To help you in the cause, we have reviewed some excellent smartphones in this article. Although a phone with video stabilization can cost a lot, there are some affordable ones too. Pick the one that falls in your price bracket and start capturing smooth videos.

### 9\. iPhone 12 Pro Max

The largest and most opulent of Apple's 2020 iPhones, the 12 Pro Max, looks to have a similar three-sensor layout to its predecessor, but it claims a slew of extra innovations, including a sector first. Released on October 11, 2020, it has a starting price of $999.

Since the announcement of the iPhone 12 Pro Max, the sensor-shift OIS (optical image stabilization) technology has been the camera's most talked-about feature. It has helped to improve Apple's already excellent night mode photography, resulting in even less noise and crisper pictures than before.

The three 12Mp sensors (a primary, 120Â° ultra-wide, and 2.5x optical zoom telephoto) shot with a satisfying uniformity and assurance that competing camera phones don't have.

### 10\. [Xiaomi Mi Note 10](https://www.mi.com/global/mi-note-10/)

The Xiaomi Mi Note 10 has a quality finish and equipment that distinguishes it from the competition. The phone has a higher frame rate of 90Hz, which offers a smooth experience, and it is HDR10+ approved. It features a selfie camera blow cut-out in the top-left quadrant, giving the display 19.5:9 ratios.

The optics are the major focus of the Mi Note 10, with the phone receiving a 108-megapixel sensor as the main structure, which has a 1/1.33-inch sensor and OIS. The second sensor is a 13-megapixel ultra-wide lens with a 123-degree field of view, which sits beside a 2-megapixel macro camera and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. Moreover, it was launched on February 13, 2020, and has a starting price of $425.

## Part 2: What's the difference between AIS, OIS, and EIS?

The majority of people prefer OIS to EIS and AIS. A hardware method is usually superior to a software platform since EIS is simply a repair solution that causes image resolution deterioration by cutting it and predicting what it would look like if it were constant.

Because Huawei just recently introduced AIS, most people are unaware of it. However, you'll understand the difference after reading the following:

### **Optical Image Stabilization (OIS)**

OIS is a motor-powered mechanical image stabilization technique that stabilizes the shooting process by sensing a camera shake and repositioning the lens using clutches to counterbalance it.

### 9\. iPhone 12 Pro Max

The largest and most opulent of Apple's 2020 iPhones, the 12 Pro Max, looks to have a similar three-sensor layout to its predecessor, but it claims a slew of extra innovations, including a sector first. Released on October 11, 2020, it has a starting price of $999.

Since the announcement of the iPhone 12 Pro Max, the sensor-shift OIS (optical image stabilization) technology has been the camera's most talked-about feature. It has helped to improve Apple's already excellent night mode photography, resulting in even less noise and crisper pictures than before.

The three 12Mp sensors (a primary, 120Â° ultra-wide, and 2.5x optical zoom telephoto) shot with a satisfying uniformity and assurance that competing camera phones don't have.

### 10\. [Xiaomi Mi Note 10](https://www.mi.com/global/mi-note-10/)

The Xiaomi Mi Note 10 has a quality finish and equipment that distinguishes it from the competition. The phone has a higher frame rate of 90Hz, which offers a smooth experience, and it is HDR10+ approved. It features a selfie camera blow cut-out in the top-left quadrant, giving the display 19.5:9 ratios.

The optics are the major focus of the Mi Note 10, with the phone receiving a 108-megapixel sensor as the main structure, which has a 1/1.33-inch sensor and OIS. The second sensor is a 13-megapixel ultra-wide lens with a 123-degree field of view, which sits beside a 2-megapixel macro camera and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. Moreover, it was launched on February 13, 2020, and has a starting price of $425.

## Part 2: What's the difference between AIS, OIS, and EIS?

The majority of people prefer OIS to EIS and AIS. A hardware method is usually superior to a software platform since EIS is simply a repair solution that causes image resolution deterioration by cutting it and predicting what it would look like if it were constant.

Because Huawei just recently introduced AIS, most people are unaware of it. However, you'll understand the difference after reading the following:

### **Optical Image Stabilization (OIS)**

OIS is a motor-powered mechanical image stabilization technique that stabilizes the shooting process by sensing a camera shake and repositioning the lens using clutches to counterbalance it.

### **AI Image Stabilization (AIS)**

AIS is an image stabilization technique driven by AI that enables the camera to record long exposure films or pictures, particularly in low light circumstances, while preserving a clear and detailed image free of blur.

### **Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS)**

EIS is an image stabilization technology that examines the picture of about two-thirds of the camera sensor and then uses the images at the borders to adjust for camera motions. This is the strategy used by the vast majority of cameras.

**Conclusion**

Since you don't always have a camera to capture smooth videos, having an OIS camera phone is the need of the hour. To help you in the cause, we have reviewed some excellent smartphones in this article. Although a phone with video stabilization can cost a lot, there are some affordable ones too. Pick the one that falls in your price bracket and start capturing smooth videos.
