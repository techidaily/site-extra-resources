## Complete Comparison

**Design and Interface:**

1. **Weight and Size:**  
 When you look at Sony from front side, it appears thinner but this device is little heavier as compared to GoPro unit. You need not to apply any additional protective arrangement to your Sony action camera yet it will serve with splash resistant capabilities. Go Pro hero4 Black is a tiny device with dimensions 41x59x30mm when here is no housing attached.
2. **Display (Screen):**  
 GoPro Hero4 Black comes with 2 inch touch screen type display that assists users in easy preview. One can playback his shots, trim recorded footage and also adjust basic settings from this display. SONY FDR X1000V possesses built in LCD display that provides 2.8 times better results as compared to its predecessors.
3. **Interface:**  
 The Sony device includes so many control options with its menus and extended sub menus. They can help you to navigate through various tasks such as switching to Wi-Fi connectivity. You will find 12 buttons on its hardware that can be used for various settings. On the other side the GoPro interface is rated as simpler and intuitive with 11 buttons.
**Performance:**

 If we track the specifications of both these devices then definitely GoPro Hero4 wins with its feature rich design. GoPro can capture breath-taking stills with its 12MP resolution whereas Sony device is limited to 8.8MP capabilities. The Field of View offered by both devices is 120 degrees but in case of Sony photos can be captured at 170 degree focus. In both these cameras you can preview your captured photographs side by side.

 When stills are captured in normal light conditions using GoPro device they result in sharper colour information with perfect adjustments of reds and greens. The GoPro colour settings can be enabled or disabled by user as per need. But in case of Sony FDR you will find more influence of blue in stills. This feature make it suitable action camera for snowboarders and surfers as they can capture the colour of sky or ocean with much better clarity. The low light details are finer in case of GoPro with sharp resolution.

 Time-lapse video mode is supported by both cameras but Sony device limits its capabilities to 1080p resolution level whereas you can achieve 4K shooting with GoPro Hero4 Black. Sony also demands little efforts for generation of time lapse videos after footage generation but in case of GoPro you will get ready to upload file at the end. You will avail impressive results with both cameras even in adverse weather conditions and footage will not appear shaky. Audio track was observed to provide better results in case of GoPro where noise attenuation is much finer.

**Waterproof:**

 Although Sony FDR is a waterproof device without housing but it can go under water only up to 32 feet whereas Hero4 is a dive special unit that can reach up to 131 feet. Sony is no doubt bulkier as compared to its competitor with its splash resistant body but at the same time features are approaching to serve best.

The GoPro colour settings can be enabled or disabled by user as per need. But in case of Sony FDR you will find more influence of blue in stills. This feature make it suitable action camera for snowboarders and surfers as they can capture the colour of sky or ocean with much better clarity. The low light details are finer in case of GoPro with sharp resolution.

 Time-lapse video mode is supported by both cameras but Sony device limits its capabilities to 1080p resolution level whereas you can achieve 4K shooting with GoPro Hero4 Black. Sony also demands little efforts for generation of time lapse videos after footage generation but in case of GoPro you will get ready to upload file at the end. You will avail impressive results with both cameras even in adverse weather conditions and footage will not appear shaky. Audio track was observed to provide better results in case of GoPro where noise attenuation is much finer.

**Waterproof:**

 Although Sony FDR is a waterproof device without housing but it can go under water only up to 32 feet whereas Hero4 is a dive special unit that can reach up to 131 feet. Sony is no doubt bulkier as compared to its competitor with its splash resistant body but at the same time features are approaching to serve best.

**Battery and Memory:**

 Sony X1000 action camera provides outstanding battery life with its 1240 mAh module but on the other side GoPro comes with 1160mAh battery capability. FDR has rechargeable battery and it can serve up to 3 hours 17 minutes when user is working with 1080p resolution but prefer to keep Wi-Fi off. Hero4 can work tirelessly up to 1.54 hours with series of photos. Prefer to use MicroSDXC card for better storage results with Sony device whereas Hero4 Black works fine with Class 10 cards.

**Wi-Fi and Apps:**

 Both action cameras are Wi-Fi enabled so you can have remote control on your footage but if we talk about GPS then this feature is missing in GoPro Hero4 Black. Although there are 12 buttons on Sony and 11 on GoPro body but Wi-Fi enabled applications assists in easy navigation.

**Conclusion:**

 Those who are in search of impressive image quality can go ahead with Sony FDRX1000V but for under water needs GoPro device is proven to be better. The footage sharpness is higher in GoPro with its higher frame rate settings and stills here appear much vibrant. You will definitely find so many advantages of GoPro that is why it is a leader in action camera market but at the same time Sony has its own strengths even with and offering that is $140 cheaper and still has longer battery life as well as GPS capability.

 Selection for right device completely depends upon your requirements as both these units have excellence in unique features. It is advised to rate features as per your need and then pick your device from market to avail maximum benefits. On price point of view, definitely you should go for Sony FDR X1000V.

2. **Display (Screen):**

SONY FDR X1000V possesses built in LCD display that provides 2.8 times better results as compared to its predecessors.
3. **Interface:**  
 The Sony device includes so many control options with its menus and extended sub menus. They can help you to navigate through various tasks such as switching to Wi-Fi connectivity. You will find 12 buttons on its hardware that can be used for various settings. On the other side the GoPro interface is rated as simpler and intuitive with 11 buttons.
**Performance:**

 If we track the specifications of both these devices then definitely GoPro Hero4 wins with its feature rich design. GoPro can capture breath-taking stills with its 12MP resolution whereas Sony device is limited to 8.8MP capabilities. The Field of View offered by both devices is 120 degrees but in case of Sony photos can be captured at 170 degree focus. In both these cameras you can preview your captured photographs side by side.

 When stills are captured in normal light conditions using GoPro device they result in sharper colour information with perfect adjustments of reds and greens. The GoPro colour settings can be enabled or disabled by user as per need. But in case of Sony FDR you will find more influence of blue in stills. This feature make it suitable action camera for snowboarders and surfers as they can capture the colour of sky or ocean with much better clarity. The low light details are finer in case of GoPro with sharp resolution.

 Time-lapse video mode is supported by both cameras but Sony device limits its capabilities to 1080p resolution level whereas you can achieve 4K shooting with GoPro Hero4 Black.

 Although Sony FDR is a waterproof device without housing but it can go under water only up to 32 feet whereas Hero4 is a dive special unit that can reach up to 131 feet. Sony is no doubt bulkier as compared to its competitor with its splash resistant body but at the same time features are approaching to serve best.

**Battery and Memory:**

 Sony X1000 action camera provides outstanding battery life with its 1240 mAh module but on the other side GoPro comes with 1160mAh battery capability. FDR has rechargeable battery and it can serve up to 3 hours 17 minutes when user is working with 1080p resolution but prefer to keep Wi-Fi off. Hero4 can work tirelessly up to 1.54 hours with series of photos. Prefer to use MicroSDXC card for better storage results with Sony device whereas Hero4 Black works fine with Class 10 cards.

**Wi-Fi and Apps:**

 Both action cameras are Wi-Fi enabled so you can have remote control on your footage but if we talk about GPS then this feature is missing in GoPro Hero4 Black. Although there are 12 buttons on Sony and 11 on GoPro body but Wi-Fi enabled applications assists in easy navigation.

**Conclusion:**

 Those who are in search of impressive image quality can go ahead with Sony FDRX1000V but for under water needs GoPro device is proven to be better. The footage sharpness is higher in GoPro with its higher frame rate settings and stills here appear much vibrant. You will definitely find so many advantages of GoPro that is why it is a leader in action camera market but at the same time Sony has its own strengths even with and offering that is $140 cheaper and still has longer battery life as well as GPS capability.

 Selection for right device completely depends upon your requirements as both these units have excellence in unique features.

You need not to apply any additional protective arrangement to your Sony action camera yet it will serve with splash resistant capabilities. Go Pro hero4 Black is a tiny device with dimensions 41x59x30mm when here is no housing attached.
2. **Display (Screen):**  
 GoPro Hero4 Black comes with 2 inch touch screen type display that assists users in easy preview. One can playback his shots, trim recorded footage and also adjust basic settings from this display. SONY FDR X1000V possesses built in LCD display that provides 2.8 times better results as compared to its predecessors.
3. **Interface:**  
 The Sony device includes so many control options with its menus and extended sub menus. They can help you to navigate through various tasks such as switching to Wi-Fi connectivity. You will find 12 buttons on its hardware that can be used for various settings. On the other side the GoPro interface is rated as simpler and intuitive with 11 buttons.
**Performance:**

 If we track the specifications of both these devices then definitely GoPro Hero4 wins with its feature rich design. GoPro can capture breath-taking stills with its 12MP resolution whereas Sony device is limited to 8.8MP capabilities. The Field of View offered by both devices is 120 degrees but in case of Sony photos can be captured at 170 degree focus. In both these cameras you can preview your captured photographs side by side.

 When stills are captured in normal light conditions using GoPro device they result in sharper colour information with perfect adjustments of reds and greens. The GoPro colour settings can be enabled or disabled by user as per need. But in case of Sony FDR you will find more influence of blue in stills. This feature make it suitable action camera for snowboarders and surfers as they can capture the colour of sky or ocean with much better clarity. The low light details are finer in case of GoPro with sharp resolution.

 Time-lapse video mode is supported by both cameras but Sony device limits its capabilities to 1080p resolution level whereas you can achieve 4K shooting with GoPro Hero4 Black. Sony also demands little efforts for generation of time lapse videos after footage generation but in case of GoPro you will get ready to upload file at the end. You will avail impressive results with both cameras even in adverse weather conditions and footage will not appear shaky. Audio track was observed to provide better results in case of GoPro where noise attenuation is much finer.

**Waterproof:**

 Although Sony FDR is a waterproof device without housing but it can go under water only up to 32 feet whereas Hero4 is a dive special unit that can reach up to 131 feet. Sony is no doubt bulkier as compared to its competitor with its splash resistant body but at the same time features are approaching to serve best.

**Battery and Memory:**

 Sony X1000 action camera provides outstanding battery life with its 1240 mAh module but on the other side GoPro comes with 1160mAh battery capability. FDR has rechargeable battery and it can serve up to 3 hours 17 minutes when user is working with 1080p resolution but prefer to keep Wi-Fi off. Hero4 can work tirelessly up to 1.54 hours with series of photos. Prefer to use MicroSDXC card for better storage results with Sony device whereas Hero4 Black works fine with Class 10 cards.

**Wi-Fi and Apps:**

 Both action cameras are Wi-Fi enabled so you can have remote control on your footage but if we talk about GPS then this feature is missing in GoPro Hero4 Black. Although there are 12 buttons on Sony and 11 on GoPro body but Wi-Fi enabled applications assists in easy navigation.

**Conclusion:**

 Those who are in search of impressive image quality can go ahead with Sony FDRX1000V but for under water needs GoPro device is proven to be better. The footage sharpness is higher in GoPro with its higher frame rate settings and stills here appear much vibrant. You will definitely find so many advantages of GoPro that is why it is a leader in action camera market but at the same time Sony has its own strengths even with and offering that is $140 cheaper and still has longer battery life as well as GPS capability.

 Selection for right device completely depends upon your requirements as both these units have excellence in unique features. It is advised to rate features as per your need and then pick your device from market to avail maximum benefits. On price point of view, definitely you should go for Sony FDR X1000V.
