Now that we know how to convert SSA subtitle format to SRT format, let’s convert XML format into SRT this time.

## How to Convert XML to SRT

Step1 First of all, go to the [GoTranscript Subtitle Converter](https://gotranscript.com/subtitle-converter).

Step2 Now click on the “Upload” option and select the XML subtitle from your device.

After TTML, it’s time to convert STL subtitles to SRT format.

## How to Convert STL to SRT

Made for broadcasting purposes, STL subtitles are a professional type of subtitles that use some special encodings. So most common video players can't support these files and you need to convert them into SRT files that are more of a universal type.

The last subtitle format we’ll be converting into SRT is the VOB format. Let’s see how to do it.

## How to Convert VOB to SRT

A .vob file extension is a DVD Video Object file that contains video, audio, or even subtitles contents. Most media players can't sort out these types of subtitle files so you must convert them into an SRT file before use.

Step1 First of all, go to the [GoTranscript Subtitle Converter](https://gotranscript.com/subtitle-converter).
