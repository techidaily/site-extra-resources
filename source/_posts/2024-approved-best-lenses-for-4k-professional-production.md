It can also have a square type groove in the middle portion that works like a holder for filters.

#### 2. Sensor Size

 One more essential factor that demands your attention at the time of lens purchase is the camera sensor format. You can find a wide range of sensors in market ranging between Micro Four Thirds, Crop Sensors and Full Frame type. The full frame sensors use to be the largest ones and they are designed to cover the full frame and they ensure larger image size even on smaller sensors. But, in case if you prefer to use a crop type sensor on your full frame camera then it will deliver an image as per size of sensor only. The idea is to avoid using smaller sensors on a large format type camera but in few special cases when you want to access certain specific look then they can be connected.

#### 3. Lens Adapters

The fact is that when you lose the digital contact then it is not possible to access autofocus feature; even the new lenses may also suffer with inability to adjust the aperture. Adapters also cause disturbance to the light that passes from lens to sensor that reduces the quality of exposure.

#### 4.Focal Length

 Here is one more important factor that you need to consider while buying camera lenses. Your will find camera focal length as first most parameter listed in the specification list of the device. This length is measured on millimetres scale and when it has lower value that means you will have wider viewing angle; naturally it will capture a wide scene.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

 If you are curious enough to create images of your dreams with your favourite camera then you must buy lenses. Most of the professionals advise to invest on good quality camera lenses because they offer longer lifespan. You will be glad to know that lenses that have been designed years ago can be easily mounted on latest camera units and they still ensure outstanding results.

 Those who are planning to buy new camera lenses may be little confused while making understanding for the basic specifications and features. If so, then the article below can be helpful for you as it contains details about best lenses for 4k cameras.

## How to choose the right lens for your 4k Camera?

#### 1.Lens Mount

 One of the most essential accessories for your camera lenses are mounts. All designers offer different mount systems for attaching lenses to the cameras so you can easily find a wide range of mount systems that are dedicated for DSLRs or to the mirror less systems like Micro Four Thirds, Sony E Mount, Nikon F and Canon EF. Few latest lenses also offer advanced features like making electrical contacts so that lens information gets automatically transferred to camera circuitry. It can also have a square type groove in the middle portion that works like a holder for filters.

#### 2. Sensor Size

 One more essential factor that demands your attention at the time of lens purchase is the camera sensor format. You can find a wide range of sensors in market ranging between Micro Four Thirds, Crop Sensors and Full Frame type. The full frame sensors use to be the largest ones and they are designed to cover the full frame and they ensure larger image size even on smaller sensors. But, in case if you prefer to use a crop type sensor on your full frame camera then it will deliver an image as per size of sensor only. The idea is to avoid using smaller sensors on a large format type camera but in few special cases when you want to access certain specific look then they can be connected.

#### 3. Lens Adapters

 If you have lens that is dedicated to work with certain specific mount type but now need to connect it on different mount then lens adapter can solve your trouble. You can find these adapters for all mount types but still there are few cons hidden behind their usage. Most of these adapters block the ability of digital communication between lenses and camera. The fact is that when you lose the digital contact then it is not possible to access autofocus feature; even the new lenses may also suffer with inability to adjust the aperture. Adapters also cause disturbance to the light that passes from lens to sensor that reduces the quality of exposure.

#### 4.Focal Length

 Here is one more important factor that you need to consider while buying camera lenses. Your will find camera focal length as first most parameter listed in the specification list of the device. This length is measured on millimetres scale and when it has lower value that means you will have wider viewing angle; naturally it will capture a wide scene. When lenses have longer focal length then viewers are able to find themselves nearer to the field they are shooting. Generally, the prime lenses offer fixed focal length value but zoom lenses offer a wider range.

## Best Lenses for 4k Camera Professional Production

 First of all, let us collect an idea about the major differences between still and cine lenses as it will help you to make better decision. The cine lenses are designed with robust construction and they offer lower tolerance range for all specifications. The biggest advantage of using Cine lenses is that they offer great quality even in bad weather conditions but due to all these advanced features, cine lenses are often found more expensive as compared to still lenses.
