The action cameras are always desired to be friendly with all weather conditions. When you go to buy one, prefer to pick a water resistant product otherwise go for a special waterproof case for its safe housing.

#### 4.Budget

We always need to care about this factor; when you have an idea about your budget then it will be much easier to filter out best camera unit for you. You can generally find action cams falling in four pricing groups:

Extremely Low Budget: below $50\. [Low Budget: $50 to $100.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)  
[Mid Range: $100 to $200.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)  
High End Budget: $200 or more.  
Generally the low price models possess few basic features only whereas higher end cam models will be loaded with abilities of live streaming, image stabilization, waterproofing, improved Wi-Fi connectivity and breathtaking resolution.

#### 5.Resolution and Frame Rate

When we have to rate quality of an action camera then resolution and frame rate are considered as major aspects. Higher resolution means you are going to capture videos and images with outstanding clarity. On the other side, frame rate deals with the smoothness of footage; higher frame rate provides much smoother footage.

#### 6.Field of View

The field of view can be defined as the total viewable area through cam lens at any particular instant. In is measured in terms of angle where larger angle provides wider projection with immersive recording.

#### 7.Connectivity

This feature is essential if you love to upload your images as well as videos on social media websites or wish to transfer them to other devices like computer or smart phone. The latest models of action cams are loaded with various connectivity options including Wi-Fi so one can easily send trip collections to other devices.

#### 8.[GPS](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

GPS here stands for Global Positioning System and presently all photographers wish to have a GPS enabled camera unit. Such advanced models help to generate automatic geo- tags for all your images as well as videos. When you come back from your tour and upload camera collection on websites then they will appear with exact locations where you have captured them all.

#### 9.Memory

[Memory cards](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are the most common storage options for camera units due to their huge storage capacity and small size. Most of cameras make use of microSD card whereas few may contain a postage stamp sized advanced [SD card](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). When you decide to go for a long tour with your friends then always prefer to buy few extra memory cards for your camera so that a message showing storage full in your cam cannot irritate you on the way.

#### 10.Battery

Even if you spend more money for buying most advanced camera units still you will have to cope up with the trouble of batteries. It may last for few hours and when you are on a weeklong trip then your camera will not be able to accompany you so long. Experts suggest buying multiple batteries along with [a portable charger](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) so that your camera can never run out of power.

#### 11.[Accessories](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Never forget to buy all essential accessories along with your new camera unit. They can be ordered online too but always prefer to get best brands, there should be no compromise for the quality. Pick right [mounting options](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and other ad-on accessories while ensuring proper compatibility with your camera unit.
