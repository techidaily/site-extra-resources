## A Comprehensive Introduction to Quantum HDR Principles

‘Hello,

What is Quantum HDR, and how does it affect TV screen quality? Please explain to me”.

One of the fascinating aspects of technology is the never-ending innovation. However, TV terminologies can be quite confusing, that even new technologies in the industry become hard to understand.

Quantum HDR is one of the latest technologies in the TV industry that many folks still find too hard to understand.

Perhaps you’ve heard about Quantum HDR once or twice, but you still didn't know what the technology is all about, worry less because you've come to the right page to find out the unknown.

Here, we've covered all you need to know about Quantum HDR. So it's advisable that you read this article till the end.

## Part 1: What is Quantum HDR

![quantum hdr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/quantum-hdr-everything-you-may-want-to-know-about-quantum-hdr-1.jpg)

Just as the name suggests, Quantum HDR is a combination of two amazing technologies namely, ‘Quantum Dots and HDR (High dynamic range).

“Quantum HDR refers to TVs with a QLED screen that's compatible with the HDR technology.”

As we all know, HDR is used to capture more details and colors in images. So, when used in TVs, it usually affects the color accuracy and contrast ratio in images. Therefore, causing an increase in color accuracy and contrast ratio.

With the presence of HDR in TVs, bright colors become brighter, and details of pictures become more visible. Yes, it does this by increasing the maximum value for three base colors ‘Red, Green, and Blue’ - this causes colors that originated from the mix of the base colors to be brighter and more saturated.

Quantum, on the other hand, means a TV uses Quantum Dot technology - a new technology used in TV screens by industry brands like Samsung to capture more details and colors in images.

Screens made of Quantum Dot technology are also referred to as QLED. Yes, this is because such screens tend to display LED lights that use a unique black light different from other TV screens. So, as a result, TVs with such screens usually have higher brightness and contrast while preserving details of the picture.

## Part 2: What is Quantum HDR 16x, 24x, 32x, 40x?

Quantum HDD 16x, 24x, 32x, and 40x are known as peak brightness multipliers of a TV screen. Although there's clear information about these peak brightness multipliers at this point, we could tell it's another marketing strategy relating to how many metadata streams a TV’s processor would process to make the image displayed on its screen more detailed. For example, since the base brightness of a TV is 100 units, a Quantum HDR with a 16x peak brightness multiplier would have a peak brightness of 1,600 units, Quantum HDR with a 24x peak brightness multiplier would be 2,400 units, and so on.

In all, we could say the overall brightness of a Quantum HDR 16x, 24x, 32x, and 40x increases as the peak brightness multiplier increases.

## Part 3: Is there a difference between Quantum HDR and HDR?

Even though Quantum HDR is a new technology, a lot of people still mistake it to be the same as HDR. So, to help clear the air on the difference between these two techniques, we've explained their features in the comparison table below;

| **Quantum HDR** | **HDR**                                                                    |                                                                                                                       |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Meaning**     | Quantum HDR are TVs with QLED screen that's compatible with HDR technology | HDR is an advanced technology that improves the quality and display signals of HDR TV (High dynamic range television) |
| **Technology**  | \-                                                                         | High dynamic range televisions                                                                                        |
| **Brightness**  | Much Brighter                                                              | Much brighter                                                                                                         |
| **Best for**    | Televisions                                                                | camera                                                                                                                |
| **Cost**        | $1000+                                                                     | $20,000+                                                                                                              |
