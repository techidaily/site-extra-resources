 One of the most popular features of GoPro devices is their wide angle look as it assists in generation of images with large FOV. But, in some situations, the fisheye look is really a strong disturbance for images/videos as the straight lines become bent and from central location frames gets oversized. No matter whether you are shooting videos or working with photos, it is possible to remove fisheye distortion. The article below will provide you complete detail about the process of removing fisheye distortion.

## How to Remove Fisheye from GoPro Footage

### **Section 1: Enable Linear FOV mode**

**What is Linear FOV Mode**

[GoPro Hero5 Black](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is developed with various latest shooting modes and Linear FOV mode is one of those. If you switch to this mode while capturing your photos then the camera itself provides software level correction to fisheye distortion. Once the lens distortion gets removed then images are directly saved to memory card.

**Cons:**

1. Linear FOV mode cannot work with all frame rates and videos sizes. It works only with 2.7k, 1080p and below that.
2. You can use Linear FOV feature with Timelapse Photo mode but it is not accessible with Timelapse video mode.
3. It leads to edge cutting in photos as well as the parts that are close to edges get stretched with bad impression.
4. Once you have enabled linear mode on images then it is not possible to reproduce the wide angle type images.

#### 1\. Using GoPro Studio

 The desktop version of [GoPro Studio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) provides distortion correction facility. You need to follow these steps to complete your action:

 One of the most popular features of GoPro devices is their wide angle look as it assists in generation of images with large FOV. But, in some situations, the fisheye look is really a strong disturbance for images/videos as the straight lines become bent and from central location frames gets oversized. No matter whether you are shooting videos or working with photos, it is possible to remove fisheye distortion. The article below will provide you complete detail about the process of removing fisheye distortion.

## How to Remove Fisheye from GoPro Footage

### **Section 1: Enable Linear FOV mode**

**What is Linear FOV Mode**

[GoPro Hero5 Black](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is developed with various latest shooting modes and Linear FOV mode is one of those. If you switch to this mode while capturing your photos then the camera itself provides software level correction to fisheye distortion. Once the lens distortion gets removed then images are directly saved to memory card.

**Cons:**

1. Linear FOV mode cannot work with all frame rates and videos sizes. It works only with 2.7k, 1080p and below that.
2. You can use Linear FOV feature with Timelapse Photo mode but it is not accessible with Timelapse video mode.
3. It leads to edge cutting in photos as well as the parts that are close to edges get stretched with bad impression.
4. Once you have enabled linear mode on images then it is not possible to reproduce the wide angle type images.

### **Section 2: Post Production**

#### 1\. Using GoPro Studio

 The desktop version of [GoPro Studio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) provides distortion correction facility. You need to follow these steps to complete your action:

**Step 1:** First of all you need to import your GoPro camera output file with its original name and then hit the advanced settings option.

**Step 2:** Now select “Remove Fisheye” option from menu and then hit OK.

**Note:** This option can be shown only when the video you shot has fisheye effect.

**Step 3:** Finally put your clip in the conversion list on software and then convert it. You will find results without fisheye distortion.

**Cons of GoPro Studio:**

1. This software does not contain the preview panel option.

#### 2\.  Using Wondershare Filmora

 Although there are so many professional video or image cutting/editing tools like Adobe Premier and Final Cut Pro etc. that can assist in fish eye correction.
