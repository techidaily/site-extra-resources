## Part 1: What a Metaverse Could Look Like?

In simple words, it refers to a shared virtual platform, which people will be able to access from various devices and where they will be able to move through virtual environments.

The entire concept might be almost a decade away from being completely recognized but it will require the tech giants to cooperate with each other.

In the month of June, Roundhill Investment, the investment firm, had created an ETF, an exchange-traded fund for tracking profit from the work of Metaverse users. Thereafter, Facebook announced its rebranding.

Today, we only have the primitive forerunners of a real Metaverse, Minecraft, Roblox, and other digital user-created worlds. One of the good examples of this idea is Fortnite, a battle royal video game taking place in a large social world. It is an idea as to what some aspects of the Metaverse might look like. Another incredible aspect is the video-conferencing apps. The only difference between this and the actual thing is the real Metaverse is not going to be limited to one game, app, virtual world, or company. It is going to connect them all.

## Part 2: What Can You Do in the Metaverse?

Here are some great examples of the Metaverse.

The best ones are in the limited editions from Bored Apes Yacht Club or Cryptopunks. As a matter of fact, Jay-Z has also posted on one of the Twitter accounts.

As a matter of fact, you will also be able to do many things together. This social aspect might be the focus of Facebook’s Metaverse that is presented in its history as a social network.

![prepare join metaverse](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/prepare-join-metaverse.jpg)

Metaverse advocates and a few researchers think that communication is going to be more natural with the help of video conferencing as you will be able to use gaze to show the person you are addressing. In fact, your avatar might also walk over to sit next to another avatar.

### 5\. Persistence

You have to keep in mind that the digital world of the Metaverse is going to be available whenever you want to pay a visit. It is possible to change it by adding new things, such as virtual buildings or other objects. The changes are going to stay there until you visit the next time. You might be able to get a residence and also own a bit. The Metaverse is going to depend on user-generated content, such as your personal stories or digital creation just as social media does.

**Bottom Line**

Metaverse is still under development but several companies have already started exploring it. In the world of cryptocurrency, The Sandbox and Decentraland are noteworthy projects. However, bigger companies, such as NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Facebook are also getting involved. With the development of AR, VR, and AI, it is most likely that you will come across some exciting features in digital and borderless work. So, the Metaverse is surely something that everybody is looking forward to.

## Part 1: What a Metaverse Could Look Like?

Metaverse is a combination of different technological elements, including AR, VR, and video where the users live inside a virtual universe. The advocates of Metaverse envision the users playing, working, or remaining connected with their loved ones through everything, from conferences to concerts.

![What is Metaverse](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/what-is-metaverse.jpg)

In simple words, it refers to a shared virtual platform, which people will be able to access from various devices and where they will be able to move through virtual environments.

The entire concept might be almost a decade away from being completely recognized but it will require the tech giants to cooperate with each other.

In the month of June, Roundhill Investment, the investment firm, had created an ETF, an exchange-traded fund for tracking profit from the work of Metaverse users. Thereafter, Facebook announced its rebranding.

Today, we only have the primitive forerunners of a real Metaverse, Minecraft, Roblox, and other digital user-created worlds. One of the good examples of this idea is Fortnite, a battle royal video game taking place in a large social world. It is an idea as to what some aspects of the Metaverse might look like. Another incredible aspect is the video-conferencing apps. The only difference between this and the actual thing is the real Metaverse is not going to be limited to one game, app, virtual world, or company. It is going to connect them all.
