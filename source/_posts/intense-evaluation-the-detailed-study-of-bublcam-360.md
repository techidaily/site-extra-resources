With the help of this BublXplo app you will need to search your camera unit via phone using Wi-Fi connectivity and after making connection like a standard hotspot, you will be able to control the 360° camera from distance mode. On the other side, this camera can also be controlled with the help of Bubl Power Button option where you can capture photos as well as videos with just a single tap.

**Image and Video Quality**

**Image:** The complete package of Bublcam use to consist of 4 different cameras having 5 megapixel capacities where each one of these possess 1.2 mm lens. All these cameras work together to capture a complete 360 degree view with 14 megapixel clarity and the results are fully spherical.

**Video:** The Bublcam being a 360 degree camera unit has power to capture whole world surrounding us in a single shot. There are two different output sizes for videos captured by Bublcam spherical camera i.e. 1080p at 30fps, 1440 at 15fps. Although none of these will give you full HD experience, size ranges of captured videos are nominal that can be stored easily and images can also be stretched out up to 4 times spaces. If you set your video mode to 1440p video setting then it will lead to decent clarity and wonderful image brightness.

**How to Edit**

 The most amazing thing to know about Bublcam 360 is that captured photographs are automatically stitched inside so that users need not to spend additional time for this task. To capture your photographs you simply need to adjust settings and then press shutter, rest all is managed by the cam itself. In order to share your captured memories on other devices you are free to use Wi-Fi connectivity as well as USB port.
