This approach could be helpful to make the entire PowerPoint presentation more dynamic and lucrative that further keeps the audience engaged throughout the session.

## Part 2: How to Change the Speed of a PowerPoint Animation

In addition to modifying the playback speed of the video that you have imported to PowerPoint presentation, you can even customize the overall duration of the animations that each of the slides the app has.

Although you can customize the speed for each object individually, increasing or decreasing the animation speed in a single go not only saves you a lot of time but also simplifies the entire customization process as well.

The method that is given below explains how you can change the speed of a PowerPoint animation of a slide:

**Step 1: Get to the Target Slide**

Launch Microsoft PowerPoint and open the presentation that has the animations that you want to speed up, and go to the target slide.

**Step 2: Change the Speed of the Animations**

Go to the **Animation** tab from the top. Press **Ctrl** \+ **A** to select all the objects on the canvas. Now, modify the value in the **Duration** field that is present in the **Timing** section of the ribbon.

Where increasing the duration slows down the animation speed, decreasing it speeds up the animation. Simply put, the value in the duration field is inversely proportional to the speed of the animation.

![change animation speed powerpoint](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-animation-speed-powerpoint.jpg)

**Note:** You can follow the same procedure to manage the animation speed for all the slides in the presentation.

## Part 3: FAQs About Change PPT Speed

**Q1) Why is my video lagging in PowerPoint?**

There could be several reasons for this. Some of the common ones are listed below:

* You may have not configured the playback speed correctly (To fix this, go to the Windows Media Player Properties box as explained earlier, and configure various resolution and speed options accordingly)
* Your GPU is old, and doesn’t support the resolution of the video clip (To fix this, go to File > Info > Compress Media and choose a lower resolution) (Choose Presentation Quality on the Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 – PowerPoint 2016 versions)
* Hardware acceleration is turned off. (To fix this, go to File > Options > Advanced > Display and uncheck the ‘Display Slide Show hardware graphics acceleration’ box)

**Q2) Why I cannot insert video in PowerPoint?**

You may want to check if the video is of a compatible format. It would be good to use an MP4 video as it integrates seamlessly with most applications.

**Q3) Which video format is best for PowerPoint?**

Listed below are some of the formats that PowerPoint supports:

* \*.asf
* \*.avi
* \*.mp4, \*.m4v, \*.mov
* \*.mpg, \*.mpeg
* \*.wmv

However, considering the popularity and compatibility, MP4 is the format that is suggested by many professionals.

**Q4) Why PowerPoint cannot play media?**

Some most common reasons for this issue include:

* **Incompatible Media** – To fix this, go to File > Info and click ‘Optimize Compatibility’ (The tile will automatically appear if the presentation has an incompatible media file)
* **Unrecognized Format** – To fix this, check if the format of the video is supported by PowerPoint. If not, consider using an effective converter like Wondershare UniConverter to convert the clip to a compatible format before importing
* **Missing Codecs** – To fix this, install the required codecs on your PC. Nevertheless, if you’re using an MP4 file, it is unlikely that you encounter such an issue
* **Overly Populated ‘Temp’ Folder** – To fix this, type **%TEMP%** in the search box, and press **Enter**. Now, press **Ctrl** \+ **A** to select all the contents, and hit **Delete** to get rid of them. Next, restart the computer and try again to see if the issue is fixed

There could be several reasons for this. Some of the common ones are listed below:

* You may have not configured the playback speed correctly (To fix this, go to the Windows Media Player Properties box as explained earlier, and configure various resolution and speed options accordingly)
* Your GPU is old, and doesn’t support the resolution of the video clip (To fix this, go to File > Info > Compress Media and choose a lower resolution) (Choose Presentation Quality on the Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 – PowerPoint 2016 versions)
* Hardware acceleration is turned off. (To fix this, go to File > Options > Advanced > Display and uncheck the ‘Display Slide Show hardware graphics acceleration’ box)

**Q2) Why I cannot insert video in PowerPoint?**

You may want to check if the video is of a compatible format. It would be good to use an MP4 video as it integrates seamlessly with most applications.

Listed below are some of the formats that PowerPoint supports:

* \*.asf
* \*.avi
* \*.mp4, \*.m4v, \*.mov
