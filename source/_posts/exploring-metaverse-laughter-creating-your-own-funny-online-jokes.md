## Part 1: 20+ Metaverse Memes to Make You Laugh

Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg declared the web-based media was rebranding and had another name. It is currently going to be called Metaverse or Meta for short. This declaration started to talk all around the web, and the jokes before long followed. Not exclusively did the jokes follow, yet so did the Facebook metaverse memes.

Note: the following memes are all from the internet.
