## Bonus Tips: How To Make A General Knowledge Quiz Video On Your Own?

If you want to become a YouTuber with your own Trivia quiz channel but don't know how to create engaging content, we recommend using Filmora, a robust video editing software, to make a quiz video that's fun and informative.

With Filmora, you can easily add quizzes, graphics, and effects to your video. The software can also record your voiceover or add background music.

Here's how you can make a **general knowledge quiz video** on your own using [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/):

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

##### Step1 Upload Your Materials

Do thorough research and find informative content for your quiz video. Now, head to the Filmora website and download the software file, depending on your system. Install the program on your PC and launch it.

On the software's home page, click the **"Create New Project"** option, select **"Click here to upload a media file"** to upload your video, and drop it in the timeline.

##### Step2 Make An Intro

In the next step, start by creating an intro. To do so, open the **"Media"** tab, select a template, and drop it in the timeline once it is downloaded.

Now, head to the **"Titles"** tab, choose a text style you like and drop it in the timeline. Adjust both tracks on the template and your video file.

Click the **text track** in the timeline, add the intro text, preferably the quiz topic, and change the text color and style as you want. You can also use the **Advanced** option to add animation to your text. Click **"OK"** to save the changes.

##### Step3 Add A Quiz To The Timeline

In the third step, use the **"Titles"** tab to add the GK question and answers to your video. Also, adjust the display time and text on the timeline properly.
