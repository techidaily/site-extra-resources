A helmet mount can be a superb idea when it comes to hands-free shooting with your GoPro cameras. However, there are certain factors you need to consider before choosing your helmet mount.

In this article, we are going to discuss some of the major aspects of helmet mounts so that you can choose one most suited to your requirements.

Helmet mount is the coolest way to make the most out of your action camera and there are many ways in which the camera and mic can be mounted on the helmet. So I also provide you details on how to **mount GoPro to helmet**.

* [3\. Helmet Chin Mounts](#chin)
* [4\. GoPro Vented Helmet Strap Mount](#vented)
* [5\. GoPro Side Mount](#side)

#### **1. GoPro Flat and Curved Mounts**

![ Gopro flat curved mounts ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gopro-flat-curved-mounts.jpg)

These are basic GoPro Mounts, which can be easily mounted to any curved or flat surface so that your action camera is properly mounted at that spot. Ideally, it would help if you bought many of these waterproof adhesive mounts so that you can quickly shift your GoPro Hero from one mount to another. The mounts can be easily detached by applying a heat gun or a hairdryer.

 **Features:**

* The flat and curved adhesive mounts can be attached to any flat or curved surface
* The industrial-strength, waterproof adhesives not just ensures secured mounting but can also be removed by application of heat from a hairdryer or heat gun

#### **2. GoPro Front Facing Mounts**

![GoPro Front Facing Mounts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gopro-front-facing-mount.jpg)

The front-facing mount attaches to the flat part of the helmet to give you self portrait and front-facing angles. Just attach the base of your mount onto any part of your helmet and give it 24 hours to adhere.

 **Features:**

* The helmet front mount would let you set your action camera in a low profile position on the front of the helmet.
* The camera would extend in front of your helmet for self-recording.
* The polycarbonate body makes it extremely durable.
* It is compatible with all GoPro cameras.

#### **3. Helmet Chin Mounts**

![Helmet Chin Mounts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chin-mount.jpg)

The chin mount is going to give the users the best POV angles they would ever get.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![GoPro Vented Helmet Strap Mount](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vented-helmet-strap.jpg)

It is more or less like the front mount but makes use of a strap instead of the adhesive. The Velcro strap makes it way easier to mount and dismount your camera. You can even attach it to the strap of your backpack or ever around your leg.

 **Features:**

![ GoPro Side Mount](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/side-mount.jpg)

 **Features:**

* They can be attached to the side of your helmet or ever the vehicle.

## Optional Mounts

#### Chest Mount Harness

![ Chest Mount Harness ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gopro-chest-mount.jpg)

Though the helmet mounts are the most popular mounting option for your GoPro camera, you have many other options for mounting your GoPro.
