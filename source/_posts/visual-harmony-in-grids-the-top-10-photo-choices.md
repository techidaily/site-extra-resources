## Part 1: Why Need Photo Grid App?

Let’s say you have a couple of photos that you wish to combine as a single collage. Now, if you do it manually, then it will consume a lot of time and you won’t get a polished product.

That’s why you can consider using a photo grid editor that presents a wide range of readily available layouts and collage templates. You can just select any preferred photo grid collage maker and upload your photos to the layout. The photo grid app would present your images in a visually appealing way and would also let you add texts, stickers, filters, and so much more.

## Part 2: Top 10 Photo Grid Apps: For Web, iOS, and Android

Since photo grid makers can be used online or on your smartphone, I have shortlisted some of these best options for multiple platforms.

Do you have a couple of photos that you wish to combine and merge as a single collage or a grid? Well, if your answer is yes, and you are looking for the best photo grid app, then you have come to the right place. Now, it has become easier than ever to upload multiple photos and instantly make their grids. For this, you can use any reliable photo grid maker online or as a smartphone app. Here, I will make you familiar with ten photo grid app options that you can use on a preferred platform.

* [Part 1: Why Need Photo Grid App?](#part1)
* [Part 2: Top 10 Photo Grid Apps: For Web, iOS, and Android](#part2)

## Part 1: Why Need Photo Grid App?

Let’s say you have a couple of photos that you wish to combine as a single collage. Now, if you do it manually, then it will consume a lot of time and you won’t get a polished product.

That’s why you can consider using a photo grid editor that presents a wide range of readily available layouts and collage templates. You can just select any preferred photo grid collage maker and upload your photos to the layout. The photo grid app would present your images in a visually appealing way and would also let you add texts, stickers, filters, and so much more.
