Selfies- The images that require a front facing camera captures, are automatically stored in the Selfie album.

Screenshots- When you press the home and power button together, the screenshots of your iPhone are created and saved in the Screenshots photo album.

Places- Have you enabled location services on your iPhone? If so, then this is an ultimate way to recollect when and where you went and clicked any particular or all Apple iPhone photos at one place.
