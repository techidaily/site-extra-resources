## How to Play VOB Video in Mobile Device?

The VOB files usually have big sizes, and they demand more space in device memory, so it is not a good idea to try playing them on mobile phones. Instead, the best solution is to get the VOB video converted into an MP4 file format or any other compatible version that works perfectly on your mobile device. Below are two top-rated VOB file converters:

### 1\. [Video Converter Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/videoconverter/download/)

You can complete the conversion process by following simple instructions on screen and it will soon provide loss free converted file for your vob inputs.

## Part 3: More about VOB: What’s VOB File?

You can identify VOB files with .vob extension, and they are commonly stored inside the Video\_ts directory under DVD root. The VOB file formats are usually based on MPEG program streams and can follow few additional specifications in case of private streams.

Note that MPEG programs can also have nonstandard VOB data that leads to a private version of the stream. Generally, VOB files follow very strict subsets of MPEG programs, so in simple terms, we can say that all VOB files use to be MPEG streams, but not all MPEG streams need to follow VOB standards.

When media files are added to DVDs, they are often broken into several VOB files having a maximum size of 1GB. This approach makes content compatible with all operating systems because generally most of OS cannot read larger file size from DVDs.

A VOB file also contains few companion files; they can be BUP or IFO files commonly. You can recognize them with extension: .bup and .ifo. Out of them, the .ifo files possess complete information about DVD so that DVD player can process it easily, and the .bup files contain a copy of .ifo files for maintaining backup in case .ifo crashes.

## How to Play VOB Video in Mobile Device?

## Part 3: More about VOB: What’s VOB File?

You can identify VOB files with .vob extension, and they are commonly stored inside the Video\_ts directory under DVD root. The VOB file formats are usually based on MPEG program streams and can follow few additional specifications in case of private streams.

Note that MPEG programs can also have nonstandard VOB data that leads to a private version of the stream. Generally, VOB files follow very strict subsets of MPEG programs, so in simple terms, we can say that all VOB files use to be MPEG streams, but not all MPEG streams need to follow VOB standards.

When media files are added to DVDs, they are often broken into several VOB files having a maximum size of 1GB. This approach makes content compatible with all operating systems because generally most of OS cannot read larger file size from DVDs.

A VOB file also contains few companion files; they can be BUP or IFO files commonly. You can recognize them with extension: .bup and .ifo. Out of them, the .ifo files possess complete information about DVD so that DVD player can process it easily, and the .bup files contain a copy of .ifo files for maintaining backup in case .ifo crashes.
