## Apple Podcasts: Get Your Audio Fix Instantly

Podcasts are the new 'it' thing many creators are getting into, and audiences focus on for content consumption. Thus, many users **download Apple Podcasts,** given the vast library of content available in its repertoire.

However, as the name suggests, Apple Podcasts is available to a niche group, i.e., iOS users mainly with Apple IDs. So, how to download the episodes and listen? All are covered here.

## Part 1\. Are Apple Podcasts Free to Download?

One of the first points of concern for users when it comes to **Apple Podcasts how to download** is the cost of the app itself. On that note, it is important to mention that the app for iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch users is free to access. Lots of different shows are available for cost-less listening.

However, some of the podcasters with shows on Apple Podcasts do offer premium episodes, shows, and channels. People can subscribe to their channels with a specified fee that the creator sets on a monthly or yearly payment schedule.

Users that want to access these premium/bonus episodes, ad-free listening, get faster access to their archives and get a first look at new shows can opt for the subscription. The costs can vary as per the channels, with some offering a 7-day trial and USD 3.99 per month or other offers.

## Part 4\. Where Do Apple Podcast Downloads Go?

Now that you know the right steps to download Apple Podcasts on different devices, the question comes- where to access them? The downloaded episodes of the podcast show you save will go into the Downloaded tab of the app. This happens for both PC and mobile users.

## Part 5\. Why Can't I Download Podcasts on Apple Podcasts?

![open the system status page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/fix-evaluate-system-status-insights.jpg)

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** If there are issues in the services like App Store (for Apple Podcasts, this will appear since there is no separate listing for apps) or Apple ID. In case some appear, wait some time. the services will come back online automatically eventually.

### Issue 3: Not connecting to or unavailable Wi-Fi

**Fix: Choose cellular data instead**

The steps for activating Cellular data access permission are as follows:

Step1 On your device, click on Settings. Then, choose the Podcasts option.

Step2 Check if the Cellular Data access is active on the app. If not, enable it.

### Issue 4: Bad network connection error

Sometimes, the main cause of the failure to download Apple podcast episodes occurs due to connection issues directly. In this case, users continuously notice problems while trying to download their Podcasts app.

![choose the reset network settings option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/reset-network-settings.jpg)
