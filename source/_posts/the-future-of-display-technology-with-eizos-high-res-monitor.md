 If we talk about the contrast ratio then it is 1500:1 for EIZO ColorEdge CG318; you must be aware about the fact that even the high end monitors are able to maintain half of this contrast ratio hardly or they can somehow manage to reach 1000:1 only. Thus you can expect perfect adjustment for darker and brighter tones of this 4K monitor. This 4K monitor also has impressive addition of software to improve overall quality. The most interesting one is ColorNavigator Network Software that assists in time to time activation or deactivation of various color features while managing the calibration modes to perform different tasks.

 In terms of accuracy for color reproduction and management of wide color range, EIZO ColorEdge CG318 performs perfectly fine. The sRGB results in 100% color gamut coverage whereas Adobe RGB leads to 99% accuracy. This monitor is not just limited to production of color ranges rather it focuses more on higher accuracy. The tests were performed while measuring the color accuracy levels with Delta E settings and it was observed to sit around range of 0.60 to 1, this is really good for most of color applications.

#### 2.Self Calibration

 Till now you might have seen most of the display screens that demand huge efforts for calibration but here in case of EIZO ColorEdge CG318 you will be happy to know about it’s built in automated calibration adjustment abilities. This automatic setting helps to provide efficient results as compared to other competitive models and it will also save much time of users.

When this sensor is not in use then it automatically swings back to its normal position. As this monitor is designed with very slick design so it would be quite difficult to use any calibration instrument over it. Thus automated adjustments suit it better.

 Users can set schedules calibration timings for this monitor and when that schedule needs to run then your standby monitor will wake up automatically and it will spend few minutes for automatic calibration. Once this task is completed then it normally goes back to sleep mode.
