## First-hand review for DJI Spark

#### 1\.  Unboxing

 Although, the appearance of Spark didn't change a lot compared to [DJI Mavic Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), its tiny size and sharp color also gave us a fresh and new feeling.

###### #1\. Storage Box

 The same old foam box as used by Phantom series and [Inspire 2](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) drones is going to protect your DJI Spark. It is lightweight too. You can easily pack it inside your travelling bag because the overall weight of this box goes only up to 500 grams where 95grams is the battery weight and 300grams is weight of your tiny aircraft. This is simply the best drone to have fun in a picnic with friends because it will not add extra bourdon to your luggage.

![dji spark box](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dji-spark-box.jpg)

###### #2\. Aircraft size

 The overall dimensions of this compact drone are 143x143x55 mm whereas weight goes only up to 300 grams.

###### #3\. Battery

![dji spark battery](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dji-spark-battery.jpg)

 It can stay in air up to 16 minutes with its 1480mAh LiPo Battery. Yeah, this high end battery makes it powerful enough to let users enjoy long flight time. The total time spent on charging is observed to be one hour and 20 minutes. Here is one interesting news for all buyers, DJI Spark do not limit your charging options. It can be charged with three different modes:

* You can go for the commonly used 10 to 240 volt battery charger. If you want to charge multiple batteries at a time then prefer to go for Spark's Battery charging hub that can power-up 3 batteries at once.
* Second option is to plug into the drone directly for charging
* Third and most commonly used one is to charge it via Micro USB slot.

#### 2\. Key features

 You will be able to enjoy three different control modes with DJI Spark, they are:

* Gesture

 In this mode, you don't need phone or controller to control the drone, it can take off and land in your hand, keep following you when you waving your palm in front of its camera.
