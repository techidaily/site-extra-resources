## Artistic Anomaly: Top 10 Unique, Affordable Mac Drawers (Free)

When it comes to flawless functioning, especially in graphics designing, animations, and most importantly, during the rendering process, nothing can beat the smoothness and speed of a Mac computer. With that said, if you are a creative designer, you would hate the frequent system crashes that Windows PCs have, and most certainly, you wouldn’t like the time the non-Mac computers waste when your head is full of the creative idea.

Considering the above, we have compiled a list of some **free drawing software for Mac** that you can use as a beginner or a professional graphic designer.

The built-in **free drawing software for Mac**, Preview, has some markup tools that allow you to annotate and draw shapes on the images. The step-by-step instructions are given below explain how this can be done with the least effort:

Step 1: Reveal Markup Toolbar

Right-click the photo you want to edit on Mac, go to **Open With**, and click **Preview (default)**. Next, click the **Show Markup Toolbar** from the upper-right corner of the interface to get the **Markup Toolbar** under the standard toolbar.

Step 2: Use the Shapes Tool

Step 3: Use the Text Tool

Click the **Text** tool from the **Markup Toolbar**, drag the text frame to your preferred location on the image, and use the scaling handles to resize the frame.
