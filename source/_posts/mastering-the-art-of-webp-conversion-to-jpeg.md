### FAQs About WebP Converters

#### 1\. What is a WebP file?

WebP is a new type of image format developed by Google that offers both lossy and lossless compression ratio while maintaining the quality of the photo at the same time. Such pictures occupy less space on the web servers, and load comparatively faster when opened in a web browser, thus saving the Internet bandwidth.

#### 2\. Why you should use WebP format?

Since WebP files are smaller in size but still offer high picture quality, you should use the format if you are a site owner and want to utilize the web space optimally. The format also saves users’ Internet bandwidth by loading comparatively sooner on the Internet browser while surfing the web.

#### 3\. Why can’t I open WebP format on Windows 10 Photos?

WebP files are primarily prepared for web interface, and the default association of the \*.webp extension is with your web browser. Since the Photos app in Windows 10 only supports image (and sometime video) files, you need an efficient **WebP to JPG** converter to first convert the pictures to JPG format, and then open them in the Photos app that Windows 10 has.

#### 4\. How to Open WebP on Windows 10 and Mac?s

Because WebP files are intended to be used on the web, you can use your default Internet browser (Microsoft Edge for Windows and Safari for Mac) to view the images. However, if you want to open the photos like any other picture, you need to **convert WebP to JPG** before you can do so.

### FAQs About WebP Converters

#### 1\. What is a WebP file?

WebP is a new type of image format developed by Google that offers both lossy and lossless compression ratio while maintaining the quality of the photo at the same time. Such pictures occupy less space on the web servers, and load comparatively faster when opened in a web browser, thus saving the Internet bandwidth.

#### 2\. Why you should use WebP format?

Since WebP files are smaller in size but still offer high picture quality, you should use the format if you are a site owner and want to utilize the web space optimally. The format also saves users’ Internet bandwidth by loading comparatively sooner on the Internet browser while surfing the web.

#### 3\. Why can’t I open WebP format on Windows 10 Photos?

WebP files are primarily prepared for web interface, and the default association of the \*.webp extension is with your web browser. Since the Photos app in Windows 10 only supports image (and sometime video) files, you need an efficient **WebP to JPG** converter to first convert the pictures to JPG format, and then open them in the Photos app that Windows 10 has.

#### 4\. How to Open WebP on Windows 10 and Mac?s

Because WebP files are intended to be used on the web, you can use your default Internet browser (Microsoft Edge for Windows and Safari for Mac) to view the images. However, if you want to open the photos like any other picture, you need to **convert WebP to JPG** before you can do so.

5\. **How to convert photos to PDF?**
