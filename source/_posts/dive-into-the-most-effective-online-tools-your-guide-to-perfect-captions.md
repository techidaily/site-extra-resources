## The Best Subtitle Editor For Desktop

An online subtitle editor can be an excellent tool for those who want to add subtitles to their videos. However, using them has some drawbacks, such as instability and glitches.

Luckily, the [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) desktop subtitle editor is a perfect option for those who want to create subtitles and return to the video file later to resume and finish the work. The editor also offers a one-click speech-to-text feature, and you can change your font style and color or apply animations.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Below is a step-by-step guide to adding and editing subtitles on your videos using Filmora:

Step1 Launch the Filmora desktop software on your Windows or Mac system and click the **"Create New Project"** option on the main page. Now, drag and drop your file or choose the **"Click here to import media"** option to upload your video footage.

![importing youtube video to filmora to add subtitles](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/importing-youtube-video-to-filmora-to-add-subtitles.png)

Step2 In the next step, drag and drop your video to the **timeline** and click the **"Play"** icon to listen to the voiceover on the footage. Now, press the **"M"** key to add a marker.

Now, select the **"Titles"** option from the toolbar and open the **"Subtitles"** tab. **Double-click** the subtitle you want to download and preview it.

Step3 Drag and drop the subtitle template to the timeline and adjust it on your video along with the marker point. In the timeline, double-click the **subtitle template,** type the text from the video voiceover, or use the text-to-speech option to add the content.

You can also make your video clip more vibrant by adding color or templates and adjusting the text spacing!

![adding subtitles to youtube video using filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/adding-subtitles-to-youtube-video-using-filmora.png)

Step4 Click the **"Advanced"** option above the timeline, delete the preset text, and set the one you've just added.

Yay! You did it! After deleting the preset text, go to the **"Animation"** tab and apply any animation effect you want. When you're done, click **"OK."** Finally, repeat these steps for the rest of the video to add the subtitles.
