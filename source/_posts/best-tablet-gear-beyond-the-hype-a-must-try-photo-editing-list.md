## Part 1: What to Consider When Picking a Tablet for Photo Editing?

So the first and most important thing before finalizing the right tablet is that there are few things which you need to consider while picking the most suitable one. I am sure these are the things that would make your confusion of finding the best tablet for you much easier.

#### Battery life

This is one of the most important factors to look upon as you would be working for some long hours and carrying it throughout the day with you. You can check about the battery life one by watching videos and the second is with web browsing. The better one is watching videos as it eats up more battery and is easy to find about the battery life. Also, keep 8 hours as a running battery time as a standard time of checking about battery life.

#### Storage space

Though the storage space of a tablet would be lesser than the laptop it is surely a factor to look upon. Most of the tablets come between 8GB and 64GB which is small than desktops. So if you are planning to store high-definition files and software then you need to find the higher capacity tablet.

#### Size and weight

Most of the time you must be carrying the tablet in your hands so checking the size and weight is important because you don’t want the device to be heavy for you. The lighter is better so check the size and weight while purchasing to make your hands burden-free.

#### Budget

Every buying decision starts from deciding the budget at first so while picking any tablet you need to keep in mind your purchase limit so that you can make a list of those which are under your budget and on that basis you can choose the best tablet for photo editing.

#### Display

So display should be given priority as well while buying any tablet-like size of the display, resolution, brightness, coating, view angle, etc. things. Also for watching movies and entertainment stuff look for an HD resolution of a minimum 720p and an aspect ratio of 16:9.
