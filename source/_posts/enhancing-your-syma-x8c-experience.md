#### 2\.  Design

![syma vs phantom design](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/syma-vs-phantom-design.jpg)

 If we consider the appearance then it looks close to the Phantom drone but no doubt to say that few variations exists and they make it unique. The overall dimension of this drone unit is 20x20x6.5 whereas maximum weight goes up to 450 grams thus it cannot be called as a tiny drone. When weighted with camera and prop guards, then this unit has overall weight of 600 grams. This dimension and weight makes this drone much stable in air.

 This device can also be used without propeller guards because they do not have much role to play in its flights but the added benefit is that removal of prop guards leads to reduced weight and hence flight time gets little improved. The overall length of propeller is about 9” and they are designed of very high quality material.

#### 3\.  Battery Life

 Going through the quick details of Syma H8C batterie, we observed that it contains 2000mAh 2 cell type battery that takes about 180 minutes to get fully charged whereas total flight time offered by this drone is 8 min. You will find very clean and nicely built battery compartment in this device and battery fits perfectly inside it staying safe during air flights. If you want to enhance your flight time then it good to buy additional batteries of same design but ensure that they fit perfectly inside your device. The well designed plastic clip at battery cover helps to open and close it easily for putting battery inside.

#### 4\.  Flight Performance

 With the headless mode, Syma X8C appears similar to X5C design with little bigger structure. This drone unit is extremely stable with easy to fly options that appear much easier to beginners too. The best part is that this drone responds perfectly to transmitter with very small delay. The performance is much better as compared to many models of this price range. If we talk about the wind stability then larger size and heavier design make this drone much stable. It will rarely face an undesired flip due to unfavourable weather conditions so you need not to struggle more to keep it tuned to its normal position. Those who want a drone for aerial photography will also e able to take advantage from Syma X8C design.

 Controller or the transmitter of X8C device is small enough that fits perfectly in user’s hands. Construction is completed with ABS plastic material that leads to light weight structure and this controller makes use of 2.4GHz frequency band to send control signals towards drone in air. The best thing to know about Syma X8C is that it can cover the 100 meter range impressively.

#### 6\.  Camera

![syma x8c camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/syma-x8c-camera.jpg)

 A drone cannot be complete without a camera mounted on its top; hence Syma has taken care of users need and they developed Syma X8C with a camera that can record everything in air. Although, it is not able to collect video information with HD quality but you will be glad to know that it is detachable and one can also make additional adjustments over its angles to adjust focus. All the recorded videos are stored inside a 4GB MicroSD card. Further, the attached gimbal assists in much stable footage.

## Conclusion

#### 2\.  Design

![syma vs phantom design](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/syma-vs-phantom-design.jpg)

 If we consider the appearance then it looks close to the Phantom drone but no doubt to say that few variations exists and they make it unique. The overall dimension of this drone unit is 20x20x6.5 whereas maximum weight goes up to 450 grams thus it cannot be called as a tiny drone. When weighted with camera and prop guards, then this unit has overall weight of 600 grams. This dimension and weight makes this drone much stable in air.

 This device can also be used without propeller guards because they do not have much role to play in its flights but the added benefit is that removal of prop guards leads to reduced weight and hence flight time gets little improved. The overall length of propeller is about 9” and they are designed of very high quality material.

#### 3\.  Battery Life

 Going through the quick details of Syma H8C batterie, we observed that it contains 2000mAh 2 cell type battery that takes about 180 minutes to get fully charged whereas total flight time offered by this drone is 8 min. You will find very clean and nicely built battery compartment in this device and battery fits perfectly inside it staying safe during air flights. If you want to enhance your flight time then it good to buy additional batteries of same design but ensure that they fit perfectly inside your device. The well designed plastic clip at battery cover helps to open and close it easily for putting battery inside.

#### 4\.  Flight Performance

 With the headless mode, Syma X8C appears similar to X5C design with little bigger structure. This drone unit is extremely stable with easy to fly options that appear much easier to beginners too. The best part is that this drone responds perfectly to transmitter with very small delay. The performance is much better as compared to many models of this price range. If we talk about the wind stability then larger size and heavier design make this drone much stable. It will rarely face an undesired flip due to unfavourable weather conditions so you need not to struggle more to keep it tuned to its normal position. Those who want a drone for aerial photography will also e able to take advantage from Syma X8C design.
