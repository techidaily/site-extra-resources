## Clearing Up Blackouts in Facebook Live Streams Using Top Browsers

The Google Chrome browser users have expressed their dissatisfaction with Facebook's dark screen when using the browser.

Compared to mobile devices, this black semi-transparent overlay appears mainly on the Chrome desktop browser, and it doesn't occur on other browsers â€“ and it may not be delightful.

One of the most common reasons for the Facebook black screen on Chrome is a browser bug (usually in Incognito mode). Because Chrome's Incognito Mode does not support push notifications, Facebook attempts to display a notification message asking if you want to enable desktop verifications on Chrome.

First, you should know that this is not a problem that can be handled in minutes; instead, you must be patient as you must attempt numerous techniques. However, we made every effort to compile a comprehensive list of methods for resolving the Facebook black screen issue in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.

The cause of the black screen on your device might be unknown, therefore, try the methods mentioned below and see which one works for you. Let's get started.

## 1\. Refresh the Website and Re-login on Facebook

You must have probably tried this strategy with other websites if you've been using Chrome or another web browser. Unfortunately, because you have a sluggish internet connection, Facebook takes a long time to display its entire interface. So it might be slightly irritating for people who want quick access to Facebook for any reason.

The screen will go black from top to bottom or left to right in this situation. As a result, you should restart your browser or window. The interface for your account will appear after your internet connection has improved.

You can also try logging back into your account after logging out. Even if you have saved your password, there are several actions you can take to log out of your account. First, however, you can follow the below-mentioned steps to re-login your account:

1. Open Chrome or your browser's preferences.
2. Look for saved passwords or use the search bar.
3. Select Accounts from the drop-down menu.
4. Visit Facebook and restart your browser.
5. Re-enter your account using your unique credentials.

If this method doesn't work for you, try the next one!

## 2\. Use Incognito Mode in a New Window

You may be unable to remove the Facebook black screen at times. However, most of us know that a browser option known as an incognito mode is deemed secure compared to other modes. It's a period during which your activity is hidden and not recorded in your account's history. So, it is pretty safe to use incognito mode.

When you switch to Incognito Mode, and if this resolves the problem. Then, one of your extensions likely is to blame. Also, remember to clear your browser's cache and cookies; they might help.

In addition, check that any security software you have, such as firewalls or antivirus software, trusts or allows Chrome. For example, antivirus softwares restrict access to sites where they read any suspicious activity that might damage the system. So, you can turn off your security software for a while to see if it helps.

## 3\. Check Extension Conflicts

We know that web browser extensions make work easier in many ways. But, if we download several extensions that accomplish almost the same thing, they will fight with one another. Even if you don't have any extensions for the same purpose, it can happen. In this scenario, you must locate and eliminate such extensions.

Without a certain, deleting all extensions and downloading them again to locate such perpetrators is impossible. However, we will show you how to disable extensions rather than delete them.

1. Open your browser and look for "Manage Extensions" in the top right corner.
2. All installed extensions have a toggle-off option under their names.
3. Go to the Facebook accounts page after refreshing the browser.
4. Check if the problem has been resolved by reloading that page as well.

We occasionally allow all cookies without inspecting them. However, when your browser has cookies from other websites installed, it may cause Facebook to malfunction.

You may accumulate many cookies, which could slow down your system. When your smartphone does not have enough storage to save cookies, the Facebook black screen is common.

## 5\. Disable Hardware Acceleration

Chrome will employ hardware acceleration by default to improve performance when using it.

But, first, check to see whether it fixes the Facebook black screen problem.

If it successfully resolves the black screen issue, you can use the browser as your default browser.

## 7\. Reset Browser Settings

If apps or extensions modify your Chrome browser settings without your awareness, you could restore them at any time. Your saved bookmarks and passwords are not deleted, cleared, or changed.

Chrome's default search engine is changed back to Google, and your homepage and tabs, pinned tabs, content settings, cookies, site data, and extensions are reset to default.

Note that just the settings for the currently logged-in Chrome profile will be reset, and the changes will be applied to all computers or devices where your active profile is signed in. Thus, you can reset browser settings in a few steps:

It will help you understand the problem and how to solve it using the right steps.

You may be unable to remove the Facebook black screen at times. However, most of us know that a browser option known as an incognito mode is deemed secure compared to other modes. It's a period during which your activity is hidden and not recorded in your account's history. So, it is pretty safe to use incognito mode.

When you switch to Incognito Mode, and if this resolves the problem. Then, one of your extensions likely is to blame. Also, remember to clear your browser's cache and cookies; they might help.

In addition, check that any security software you have, such as firewalls or antivirus software, trusts or allows Chrome. For example, antivirus softwares restrict access to sites where they read any suspicious activity that might damage the system. So, you can turn off your security software for a while to see if it helps.

## 3\. Check Extension Conflicts

We know that web browser extensions make work easier in many ways. But, if we download several extensions that accomplish almost the same thing, they will fight with one another. Even if you don't have any extensions for the same purpose, it can happen. In this scenario, you must locate and eliminate such extensions.

Without a certain, deleting all extensions and downloading them again to locate such perpetrators is impossible. However, we will show you how to disable extensions rather than delete them.

1. Open your browser and look for "Manage Extensions" in the top right corner.
2. All installed extensions have a toggle-off option under their names.
3. Go to the Facebook accounts page after refreshing the browser.
4. Check if the problem has been resolved by reloading that page as well.

## 4\. Clear All Facebook Cookies from the Browser

Many people who are new to using the internet services are most likely to be unaware that Facebook and other websites use cookies to save our activity or primary data. We occasionally allow all cookies without inspecting them. However, when your browser has cookies from other websites installed, it may cause Facebook to malfunction.

You may accumulate many cookies, which could slow down your system. When your smartphone does not have enough storage to save cookies, the Facebook black screen is common.

## 5\. Disable Hardware Acceleration

Chrome will employ hardware acceleration by default to improve performance when using it.

When you're having trouble with Facebook's black screen, you'll need to stop hardware acceleration. To fix this problem, you should change the browser's settings. Disable Hardware by following the steps mentioned below:

1. Go to Chrome's Settings.
2. Scroll down to "Advanced" settings and select the system.
3. Turn off the Use hardware acceleration when an available button.
4. To apply the changes, restart the browser.

## 6\. Try Using a Different Web Browser

If you've tried all the ways on your preferred browser, such as Chrome, you should try the alternative. There are numerous browsers available, including Opera, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, etc. You only need to download a browser compatible with your system's features, and you can then log into your Facebook account and utilize it as you choose. But, first, check to see whether it fixes the Facebook black screen problem.

If it successfully resolves the black screen issue, you can use the browser as your default browser.

## 7\. Reset Browser Settings

If apps or extensions modify your Chrome browser settings without your awareness, you could restore them at any time. Your saved bookmarks and passwords are not deleted, cleared, or changed.

Chrome's default search engine is changed back to Google, and your homepage and tabs, pinned tabs, content settings, cookies, site data, and extensions are reset to default.

Note that just the settings for the currently logged-in Chrome profile will be reset, and the changes will be applied to all computers or devices where your active profile is signed in. Thus, you can reset browser settings in a few steps:

1. To begin, open Google Chrome.
2. Select Options.
3. Select Advanced from the drop-down menu.
4. Select the Reset option.
5. Click Reset and then Reset again to confirm.

## 8\. Restart Your Computer

If none of the following suggestions resolve the Facebook black screen problem, you should restart your computer. A fault with the device's Hardware is likely creating the incorrect display.

In this instance, it's conceivable that the computer will figure out how to fix the problem and restore normal operation to your device. For example, the system performs a repair process if it detects some error in the softwares and applications installed on the system.

## 9\. Report to Facebook Support Team

If none of the methods listed above work for you, you should contact Facebook Support or the Facebook Help Center. Another option is to use Twitter to send a direct message to @Facebook. It will help you understand the problem and how to solve it using the right steps. In such cases, there is a possibility that there may be an issue with Facebook, or you may have unknowingly changed any setting, which might have resulted in displaying a black screen.
