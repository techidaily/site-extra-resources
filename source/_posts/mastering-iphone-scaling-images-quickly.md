### Method 1: Resizing photos via Email

 This process may not be the fastest way imaginable to change the size of your images, but it still effective.

 Simply select the pictures you want to resize in the Photos app and click share, or if you have an iPhone 7 click on the Action icon. The Mail app will allow you to choose one of the Small, Medium, Large and Actual Size presets, and after you selected the option that best fits your needs, tap the Send button to send the resized images to your email.

 Despite being relatively easy, this method of resizing images doesn't allow you to enter the new size of a photo manually which may limit your options.

### Method 2: Using apps to resize your photos

 Even though apps for iPhones that allow you to resize your photos require you to spend some money, this method is still much more effective than resizing images via email.

 iPhone photographers can resize their photos in three simple steps with this app. The Image Size app is free to download but if you want to get rid of the adds you must pay $3,99\. However, all you need to do to change the size of an image with this app is to open the photo you want to resize and select the output size. Removing the parts of the image is made possible by the Cropping tool so you can even decide which parts of the photo you want to remove. Once you've completed the process of resizing the picture you can choose whether you want to Save, Send or Share your photo.

#### 2\. [PhotoShrinker](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/photoshrinker/id928350374?mt=8)

#### 3\. [Reduce](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reduce-batch-resize-images-and-photos-for-iphone-ipad/id580474806?mt=8)
