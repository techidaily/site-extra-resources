**Step 1** – tap on the "Photos" app in your iPhone. Post launching the app, look for the layered rectangles icon located at the bottom right corner of the screen. This icon is for "Albums". Tap on it and proceed to the next step.

**Step 2** – Now, tap on "All Photos" appearing on the screen followed by choosing the image you wish to edit.

**Step 3** – Choose the "Edit" option from the screen and then you are required to tap on the "Red Eye Correction" option. This eye correction icon will be the image of an eye from which a slanting line is crossing through it.

Note: The "Red Eye Correction" option will not appear when the picture is captured without the use of flash. It will only be visible on the photos taken with flash and the screenshots.

**Step 4** – After this, tap the red eye one by one and the red eye correction feature will change pixels as needed on the tapped area. You can tap eye once again if the edit was not of your preference.

**Step 5** – lastly, tap on the eye with slash icon i.e. "Red Eye Correction" icon to return to the main edit screen. Hit on "Done" once satisfied with the results.

If in case, you feel the changes are not according to what you needed, you can again go to the edit screen and hit on "Revert" option. This will restore the original picture.
