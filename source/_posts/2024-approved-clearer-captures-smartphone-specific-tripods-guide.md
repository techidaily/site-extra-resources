## Full-Size Camera Tripods

 So, here we are going to talk about the full size tripods. Professionals often use them to handle their classy DSLR cameras and they can also hold almost all latest digital camera models including your iPhone.

 If you have planned your shoot at some windy location then these full sized tripods can ensure you trouble free results with their super steady performance. No matter whether you have connected a large camera or an iPhone on these tripods, they will always ensure perfect stability.

 Note that, this type of tripods need a tripod mount for making connection with iPhones you need to make some additional investment to buy one. Once you get a good quality mount then it can be easily used to make connection with iPhone via screw thread.

 Market is loaded with so many full size camera tripod designs, you can pick any one out of Joby series, Shoulder mount or collections offered by Glif as all of them can be used with iPhones and standard tripods.

 Here is one drawback of full sized tripod design; it is quite heavier so you cannot carry it on your tours, especially not when you are going for adventurous trips to enjoy hiking or trekking etc.
