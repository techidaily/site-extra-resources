However, you will see pixelated imagery when you zoom in, making it look rougher and lousy. That is a significant issue when dealing with graphical artwork or logos- a clear and crisp look is essential.</p><p>This is where <strong>vector images</strong> come in handy, a type of graphical image format that utilizes points, curves, and lines instead of a group of pixels to form the image structure. That works better for digital logos and graphic art, although slightly complex to edit.</p><p>If you want to find free <strong>vector stock images</strong>, several websites offer a rich library of these options, including other functions like editing vector images. Here is a list of the best ones you should consider seriously.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/best-10-websites-for-premium-quality-vector-stock-images-in-2022-1.jpg"                      alt="vector image example from vecteezy"                ></p><h2 id="Part-I-10-Top-Websites-with-Free-Stock-Vector-Images"><a href="#Part-I-10-Top-Websites-with-Free-Stock-Vector-Images" class="headerlink" title="Part I. 10 Top Websites with Free Stock Vector Images"></a>Part I. 10 Top Websites with Free Stock Vector Images</h2><p>Multiple <strong>free vectors websites</strong> are currently active.

What are the types of Vector Graphic Files?</h2><p>You can use the websites mentioned in the list here to search for various vector images and get successful results. However, the need for vector images sometimes depends on their primary use to people, like printing or web design. There are specific formats for vector stock images that you should consider carefully to download the suitable graphical file for your project.</p><ul><li><strong>.ai (Adobe Illustrator)-</strong> The AI file type mainly works for Adobe Illustrator users and is an option to replace old-school EPS files. Adobe apps can access and showcase these files in the best quality compared to other programs.</li><li><strong>.eps (Encapsulated PostScript)-</strong> The EPS or Encapsulated PostScript files are older vector image types for more extensive format-based printing. The text is easier to resize and enlarge in this lossless format with zero quality defects. It is commonly used in professional printing projects, like billboards and posters in the physical format and icons and logos in digital format. This is not compatible with other raster image formats.</li><li><strong>PDF (Portable Document Format)-</strong> The PDF file type relates to portable digital documents that are the standard option for forms, documents, and graphics. Note that this file extension type works with both raster and vector images- i.e., you can apply both images into a PDF file. In terms of usage, this format is best for getting high-quality uniform documental file prints.</li><li><strong>.svg (Scalable Vector Graphics)-</strong> SVG or Scalable Vector Graphics is the conventional vector file format that web designers focus on. It has universal open standard support, works on different browsers, and appears smooth and crisp during displays on differently-sized screens. The SVG files are mainly used for web-based file transfers.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-III-Reasons-to-Turn-to-Filmora-for-Editing-Videos-and-Adding-Graphic-Images"><a href="#Part-III-Reasons-to-Turn-to-Filmora-for-Editing-Videos-and-Adding-Graphic-Images" class="headerlink" title="Part III.

What are the types of Vector Graphic Files?</h2><p>You can use the websites mentioned in the list here to search for various vector images and get successful results. However, the need for vector images sometimes depends on their primary use to people, like printing or web design. There are specific formats for vector stock images that you should consider carefully to download the suitable graphical file for your project.</p><ul><li><strong>.ai (Adobe Illustrator)-</strong> The AI file type mainly works for Adobe Illustrator users and is an option to replace old-school EPS files. Adobe apps can access and showcase these files in the best quality compared to other programs.</li><li><strong>.eps (Encapsulated PostScript)-</strong> The EPS or Encapsulated PostScript files are older vector image types for more extensive format-based printing. The text is easier to resize and enlarge in this lossless format with zero quality defects. It is commonly used in professional printing projects, like billboards and posters in the physical format and icons and logos in digital format. This is not compatible with other raster image formats.</li><li><strong>PDF (Portable Document Format)-</strong> The PDF file type relates to portable digital documents that are the standard option for forms, documents, and graphics. Note that this file extension type works with both raster and vector images- i.e., you can apply both images into a PDF file. In terms of usage, this format is best for getting high-quality uniform documental file prints.</li><li><strong>.svg (Scalable Vector Graphics)-</strong> SVG or Scalable Vector Graphics is the conventional vector file format that web designers focus on. It has universal open standard support, works on different browsers, and appears smooth and crisp during displays on differently-sized screens. The SVG files are mainly used for web-based file transfers.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-III-Reasons-to-Turn-to-Filmora-for-Editing-Videos-and-Adding-Graphic-Images-1"><a href="#Part-III-Reasons-to-Turn-to-Filmora-for-Editing-Videos-and-Adding-Graphic-Images-1" class="headerlink" title="Part III.

In fact, 4K is now what HD was when it became a big deal a few years ago.</p><p>Cable service providers are rolling out 4K UHD channels, broadcasters are working on transmitting in 4K, and streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime already have 4K streaming options.</p><p>We’ve picked the top 10 4K TVs of 2020. This list includes last year’s flagship TVs as well as some that were launched this year. We tell you their pros and cons, and show you the features to look for in a 4K TV.

It showcases the best of LG’s OLED panel technology. OLEDs or Organic Light Emitting Diodes are self-illuminating LEDs. This makes them better at displaying richer blacks and detailed high-contrast imagery.</p><p>This 4K TV is available in 55” and 65” sizes. It’s also remarkably thin because unlike LCDs, OLEDs do not require a backlight. The LG OLEDB69 is also compatible with HDR and Dolby Vision. Its ability to handle multiple HDR formats is a big deal now that HDR is more popular and more widely used.</p><p>On the downside, the LG OLEDB6P is quite expensive. At roughly $2800, it just won’t fit into the budgets of most people. Also, due to its OLED panel, it has a brightness limit that means it could look dim in some indoor viewing conditions. We should point out that this won’t always be an issue since most people modulate the brightness of their TV and PC screens. With its fantastic image quality, this 4K TV is worth the expense for many.</p><h4 id="2-SONY-XBR-A1E-SERIES"><a href="#2-SONY-XBR-A1E-SERIES" class="headerlink" title="2. SONY XBR-A1E SERIES"></a>2.

It is Sony’s flagship TV of the year and marks the company’s foray into OLED panel technology. This OLED TV is remarkable for many reasons. It delivers flawlessly on image quality with dynamic contrast, rich blacks and bright highlights.</p><p>The Sony XBR-A1E also debuted Sony’s unique sound creation system. Its OLED panel also doubles as a speaker with inbuilt devices that vibrate it to create good quality sound. This TV also sports an ultra-minimalist look that will instantly grab attention and set a sophisticated tone in any space.</p><p>All pluses considered, this 4K TV is even more expensive than the No. 1 TV on this list. It retails for a minimum of $3500. That’s more than most people would ever spend on a TV. Also, its unique sound system is not nearly sufficient for a truly immersive entertainment experience.</p><h4 id="3-VIZIO-M-SERIES"><a href="#3-VIZIO-M-SERIES" class="headerlink" title="3.

For as low as $600, the Vizio M delivers great value for money and is quite popular with shoppers. With its full array local dimming, it renders rich blacks, better image depth, and has overall, amazing image quality. The 2017 release is also compatible with HDR and is especially good for video gaming.</p><p>While its price range makes it a steal, image quality is reduced when the Vizio M is viewed from angles. Also, screen reflection interferes with image quality especially at angles. This makes the Vizio M less than ideal for multi-viewer situations.</p><h4 id="4-SAMSUNG-Q9F"><a href="#4-SAMSUNG-Q9F" class="headerlink" title="4. SAMSUNG Q9F"></a>4.

It uses Samsung’s proprietary metal-wrapped Quantum Dots (QLED) to improve the colour and contrast range of its LCD screen. This TV does improve significantly on the native flaws of backlit LCD panels and has the record brightness levels of LCD screens. The Q9F is also compatible with multiple HDR formats.</p><p>Though it lacks the ultra-thin look of OLED TVs, the Q9F has an impressive industrial style that gives it a quietly imposing look in any space.</p><p>While Samsung gets kudos for its Quantum Dot LED technology, the Q9F is super expensive. With a retail price tag of $4997, it’s the most expensive 4K TV on this list. Also, its rendering of HDR colour isn’t always perfect. Some testers have observed HDR colour banding or striping.</p><h4 id="5-LG-OLEDC7P"><a href="#5-LG-OLEDC7P" class="headerlink" title="5. LG OLEDC7P"></a>5.

Its minimal flush bezels and ultra-slim panel have a sophisticated, high-tech feel that’s a step-up from the B6P model. It has great picture quality and support for HDR content. Also, image quality is preserved when the screen is viewed from angles. The C7P also has a high refresh rate of 120Hz which makes it perfect for fast-action video games.</p><p>The C7Ps are high-end 4K TVs. The 55” C7P retails for roughly $2999. That makes it a premium purchase. As with other OLEDs, the C7Ps also has limited peak brightness and may sometimes show image retention.</p><h4 id="6-LG-SJ8500-SERIES"><a href="#6-LG-SJ8500-SERIES" class="headerlink" title="6.

It’s built with IPS Panels which make it good at retaining image quality and colour quality at different angles. It’s also good at upscaling lower HD content. That’s important because while 4K content is no longer scarce, it still comes at a premium. The SJ8500 makes older HD content look consistently better and that’s something many shoppers will appreciate.</p><p>It has a 120Hz refresh rate with low input lag and motion blur which is good for video gaming. It also retails for less than $1300.</p><p>While its overall mix of features is great, image quality isn’t perfect on the SJ8500. Some colours appear blotchy and picture contrast is not nearly as good as with OLED or QLED screens.</p><h4 id="7-Vizio-P-Series"><a href="#7-Vizio-P-Series" class="headerlink" title="7.

It’s an LED TV that uses local dimming zones and brightness enhancements to improve image quality. It was rated tops for image quality in dark viewing situations and has good support for HDR content.</p><p>It comes in 4 sizes ranging from 50” to 75”. It’s also very affordably priced with the 50” retailing for a bit more than $800. The sizes have different features however and shoppers should keep this in mind when weighting their options. For instance, all sizes except the 50” have a refresh rate of 120Hz.</p><p>On the downside, the Vizio P’s screen reflects light when used in brightly lit room. Image quality also diminishes significantly when it’s viewed from angles. Finally, it doesn’t have a native smart TV OS. Instead, it’s controlled via an android app and can handle Google Chromecast streaming through its accompanying tablet.</p><h4 id="8-Samsung-QNQ7F-series"><a href="#8-Samsung-QNQ7F-series" class="headerlink" title="8.

It has an elegant no-bezel screen that can make watching movies more immersive. It also has a sleek, cable-free look because it uses a fibre optic cable to connect the TV panel to the One Connect Box where its connection ports are housed. The fibre optic cable is 16ft long and is designed to let users stow the One Connect Box neatly out of sight while using their TVs. The QNQ7F has a very sophisticated, polished looked due to this impressive design.</p><p>The QNQ however, is not as good as the Q9F when it comes to image quality. It doesn’t show Samsung’s QLED technology at its best. It’s also quite expensive with a retail price of $2997.</p><h4 id="9-SAMSUNG-UN75MU800D"><a href="#9-SAMSUNG-UN75MU800D" class="headerlink" title="9. SAMSUNG UN75MU800D"></a>9.

It can connect to the internet wirelessly or through an ethernet cable. This means it can work with streaming services like Netflix and Vudu. It also comes with a detached connections box as well as a concealed connections panel behind the screen. So, it can handle many external devices including PCs and digital cameras.</p><p>This TV is ideal for people who want to recreate a cinematic experience at home. Otherwise, it’s a bit too imposing for a family living room. Also, it’s very expensive.

Also, the screen and sound bar can both be mounted on a wall.</p><p>The picture quality on the DX802 is remarkably good. It supports HDR well and delivers images with great depth and colour. Its edge-lit panel and local dimming feature delivers good colour, brightness and contrast for HD content.</p><p>While its design puts it in a class of its own, the colour coverage and brightness levels of the DX802 could be better. Also, this 4K TV is somewhat expensive. It’s 50” version is nearly $1500.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Best-Aspect-Ratios-to-Enhance-Video-Quality"><a href="#Best-Aspect-Ratios-to-Enhance-Video-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Best Aspect Ratios to Enhance Video Quality"></a>Best Aspect Ratios to Enhance Video Quality</h2><p>Video aspect ratios are changing depending on which platform you are using. Knowing the characteristics about aspect ratios is crucial to accomplish the ideal visual appeal across any platform.</p><p>If you want to learn more about video aspect ratios, how to apply them to different social media platforms, then you are in the right place! This article will explain what a video aspect ratio is, it includes common video aspect ratios you see nowadays, and includes recommended aspect ratios for video on various social media platforms.</p><p>With that said, let’s dive right into it!</p><h2 id="1-What-is-a-video-aspect-ratio"><a href="#1-What-is-a-video-aspect-ratio" class="headerlink" title="1. What is a video aspect ratio?"></a>1. What is a video aspect ratio?</h2><p>Aspect ratio is a digital image projection attribute describing the distance between the width and the height of an image. The dimensions are also defined as shapes such as a square which is 4:3. A rectangle represents the 16:9 standard high definition aspect ratio, and inverted what you see on phones, that will be 9:16. 9 refers to the width and 16 to the height.</p><h2 id="2-Commonly-used-aspect-ratios"><a href="#2-Commonly-used-aspect-ratios" class="headerlink" title="2. Commonly used aspect ratios"></a>2. Commonly used aspect ratios</h2><p>There is no same aspect ratio that is used across all social media platforms. Depending on which social media platform you are planning to upload, you have to make sure you have the correct aspect ratio for your target audience. The optimal viewing experience is what matters.</p><h3 id="16-9-Widescreen"><a href="#16-9-Widescreen" class="headerlink" title="16:9 Widescreen"></a>16:9 Widescreen</h3><p>This aspect ratio is recognized as the worldwide reference format for film, mobile devides, DSLR cameras, streaming platforms, social media platforms, and many more. It is known as landscape viewing which include 720p, 1080p HD and 4K resolution.</p><h3 id="4-3-Standard"><a href="#4-3-Standard" class="headerlink" title="4:3 Standard"></a>4:3 Standard</h3><p>This resolution is originally used in older television screens, which transformed into mobile use as this aspect ratio works really well for Instagram and Facebook videos, referring to the 9:16 phone resolution making a square video more pleasant to watch and to be featured in in-feed videos.</p><h3 id="9-16-Vertical"><a href="#9-16-Vertical" class="headerlink" title="9:16 Vertical"></a>9:16 Vertical</h3><p>The 9:16 aspect ratio has become the mainstream resolution for smartphones for easier viewing of videos. This resolution allows for the vertical display of videos on tablets and phones, meaning that it allows videos to play while the device is being held in its upright position. This works ideally for Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube Shorts, and more.</p><h3 id="21-9-Cinematic-Widescreen"><a href="#21-9-Cinematic-Widescreen" class="headerlink" title="21:9 Cinematic Widescreen"></a>21:9 Cinematic Widescreen</h3><p>The 21:9 resolution is designed for filming ultra-wide screen movies that gives the viewer a theater-like feeling. It’s mostly used to display films and movies in anamorphic formats. Just like on ultra-wide monitors, it allows the video to be shown across the entire screen, giving you a cinema-like experience. This resolution contributes to a broader viewing experience in any shape or form.</p><h2 id="3-Which-aspect-ratio-should-I-choose"><a href="#3-Which-aspect-ratio-should-I-choose" class="headerlink" title="3. Which aspect ratio should I choose?"></a>3. Which aspect ratio should I choose?</h2><p>Depending on your project, broadcast location and filming options, here you can find an overview of which platforms are using which resolutions and how you can use that to improve your filming and viewer experience.</p><h3 id="Facebook"><a href="#Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Facebook"></a>Facebook</h3><p>Facebook is one of the most used website across the world on both computer and the mobile app. This is a great platform to let people discover your content. In order to please new viewers, let’s look at the resolutions Facebook supports and which one would be your best option depending on your content.</p><p>4:3 or 1:1 for Facebook feed videos</p><p>16:9 for in-stream ads on Facebook</p><p>9:16 for Facebook live videos</p><p>9:16 for Facebook stories</p><h3 id="YouTube"><a href="#YouTube" class="headerlink" title="YouTube"></a>YouTube</h3><p>To this day, it’s safe to say that YouTube is the leading platform in the video industry. Not only because of how long they have been around, but also about how much content is uploaded every minute and how many users it has each month. To give the viewers the best experience, here are the top aspect ratios we recommend when posting content onto your YouTube channel.</p><p>16:9 for YouTube live streams</p><p>9:16 for YouTube Shorts</p><p>16:9 for regular HD videos</p><p>21:9 for cinematic videos&#x2F;shortfilms</p><h3 id="Instagram"><a href="#Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Instagram"></a>Instagram</h3><p>When talking about Instagram, which is very similar to Facebook, use these aspect ratios to ensure that your quality will be the best of the best.</p><p>9:16 for Instagram Reels</p><p>4:3 for Instagram feed advertisements</p><p>9:16 for Instagram Story advertisements</p><p>9:16 for Instagram Stories</p><p>4:3 or 1:1 for Instagram feed videos</p><p>9:16 for Instagram Live streams</p><p>9:16 for IGTV</p><h3 id="TikTok"><a href="#TikTok" class="headerlink" title="TikTok"></a>TikTok</h3><p>Before Musical.ly users were migrated to a new platform called TikTok in 2018, it has been the leader on the board for a long time, and here are the recommended resolutions we think give the best results. Tik Tok allows you to share short videos, and is used by young people as an outlet to show their talents whether it’s dancing, singing, cooking, comedy or any other form of entertainment they can express and use on the platform. There’s also a feature to work together and collaborate with other Tik Tok creators across the globe.</p><p>16:9 for organic Tik Tok feed videos</p><p>16:9 for Tik Tok live videos</p><p>1:1; 16:9 or 9:16 for TikTok advertisements</p><h2 id="4-How-to-adjust-the-aspect-ratio-of-a-video"><a href="#4-How-to-adjust-the-aspect-ratio-of-a-video" class="headerlink" title="4. How to adjust the aspect ratio of a video?"></a>4. How to adjust the aspect ratio of a video?</h2><p>A very important point we’d like to mention is that we don’t recommend changing the aspect ratio after filming, because it could harm the video quality and we think it’s best to choose the aspect ratio on your phone or camera before filming, besides that we have some great tips for optimizing your video for the watching experience below.</p><h3 id="Black-bars"><a href="#Black-bars" class="headerlink" title="Black bars"></a>Black bars</h3><p>When editing your video, adding black bars is not changing the aspect ratio as you are just adding black bars to the screen. What we do recommend is cropping the video until you get the desired result. Adding black bars won’t automatically make the platform adjust the video and it will affect the viewer experience.</p><h3 id="Cropping"><a href="#Cropping" class="headerlink" title="Cropping"></a>Cropping</h3><p>Cropping your video will allow you to remove a section from your video, which works perfect for unwanted objects or people. While cropping the video, you are forced to pick the essential part of your video and disregard the rest of the video and to remove distraction from the frame.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Having your video tested on multiple devices will allow you to see a preview of what the viewer will see and make necessary changes if needed. When your video looks perfect, you can be sure that it will give a seamless experience across all platforms, without the fear of losing video quality.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p></article[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later<p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/video-formats-face-off-determining-the-best-av1-or-vp9/"><u>Video Formats Face Off  Determining the Best, AV1 or VP9?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/new-a-4k-odyssey-begins-here-exploring-the-eizo-cg318-4k-monitor/"><u>[New] A 4K Odyssey Begins Here – Exploring the EIZO CG318-4K Monitor</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/terracore-pros-fusion-of-touch-and-high-definition/"><u>TerraCore Pros  Fusion of Touch & High Definition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/updated-behind-the-scenes-how-to-remove-background-in-picsart/"><u>[Updated] Behind the Scenes  How to Remove Background in Picsart</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/in-2024-behind-the-scenes-top-picks-of-monitors-and-tvs-for-xbox-series-x-gamers/"><u>In 2024, Behind-the-Scenes  Top Picks of Monitors & TVs for Xbox Series X Gamers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/mythos-makers-mecca-prime-pantheon-seven/"><u>Mythos Makers’ Mecca -

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Behind-The-Scenes-Understanding-M1-Technology"><a href="#Behind-The-Scenes-Understanding-M1-Technology" class="headerlink" title="Behind The Scenes: Understanding M1 Technology"></a>Behind The Scenes: Understanding M1 Technology</h2><h1 id="What-is-Apple-M1-Chip"><a href="#What-is-Apple-M1-Chip" class="headerlink" title="What is Apple M1 Chip?"></a>What is Apple M1 Chip?</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett"><a href="#Richard-Bennett" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Aug 18, 2022• Proven solutions</p><p>Up until now, Apple has been using Intel processors for its Mac. That is about to change completely as Apple introduced the first Mac with a new <strong>Apple M1</strong> chip that uses ARM-64 bit architecture. It is Apple’s first custom silicon system on a chip that is being used in the new Macs. It was already being used in iPads and iPhones, and now it is being presented in the new MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and MacBook mini.</p><h2 id="What-does-the-M1-chip-mean-for-the-new-MacBook"><a href="#What-does-the-M1-chip-mean-for-the-new-MacBook" class="headerlink" title="What does the M1 chip mean for the new MacBook?"></a>What does the M1 chip mean for the new MacBook?</h2><p>The instruction set that is being used by the ARM technology is much more simplified than x86, thus, making it more energy-efficient. Up until today, Macs used Intel processors which had multiple chips for I&#x2F;O, processor, security, and memory. The M1 chip unlike the Intel processors has combined all these chips into a single system on chip or SoC. This makes it more simple, efficient, and better at performance.</p><p>M1 is also the first personal computer chip built with 5-nanometer process technology. Apple has managed to fit 16,000,000,000 transistors in a single M1 chip, which is more than any chip ever invented for personal computers.</p><ul><li><strong>CPU</strong></li></ul><p>The CPU consists of 8 cores with 4 of them being high-performance and four high-efficiency cores. These cores can work alone unless they are needed to do high-performance tasks, in which case all 8 cores can work together. This technology makes at least 3.9 times faster than its Intel counterpart and gives the MacBook an amazing 20-hour playback on battery time.</p><ul><li><strong>GPU</strong></li></ul><p>The GPU is an eight-core integrated chip with 2.6 teraflops of raw power output. The performance tests have revealed that running around 25,000 threads concurrently gives it a better performance than the GeForce GTX 1050 Ti.</p><p>Normally, PCs need a separate chip for graphics performance, but Apple’s new integrated GPU gives it a huge performance edge with minimum power consumption. According to apple, it is the world’s fastest integrated graphics in a PC.</p><ul><li><strong>Neural Engine</strong></li></ul><p>Apple’s latest neural engine has a 16-core design which enables it to execute 11 trillion operations per second. This means that video editors can frame a click intelligently and instantly. Apart from that, the software can make the details better and sharper in no time. The new neural engine gives apple 15x faster machine learning capabilities.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/apple-m1.jpg"                      alt="apple m1 chip"                ></p><h2 id="Apple-M1-compared-to-Intel-Processors"><a href="#Apple-M1-compared-to-Intel-Processors" class="headerlink" title="Apple M1 compared to Intel Processors"></a>Apple M1 compared to Intel Processors</h2><p>The new Apple M1 chip is proving to be better than its old Intel base models. Here are a few comparisons:</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Specifications</strong></th><th><strong>Apple M1</strong></th><th><strong>Intel Core-i7</strong></th><th><strong>Intel Core-i9</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Frequency</strong></td><td>3.2 GHz</td><td>2.6 GHz</td><td>5.3 GHz</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cores</strong></td><td>8</td><td>6</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Turbo</strong> (1 Core)</td><td>None</td><td>5.10 GHz</td><td>5.00 GHz</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Turbo</strong> (All Cores)</td><td></td><td>3.20 GHz</td><td>4.70 GHz</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Core Architecture</strong></td><td>Hybrid (big. LITTLE)</td><td>Normal</td><td>Normal</td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li><strong>Apple M1 VS Intel Core-i7</strong></li></ul><p>Apple M1 beats the Intel i7 speed by 2.8 times according to Apple. The graphics are significantly better and all that with the minimum usage of power. Apple claims that the battery can last up to 20 hours.</p><p>According to a test between the new Apple Macbook with M1 chip vs Dell XPS 13 with 11th gen core-i7, the M1 performed way better than i7. The first test was opening 50 apps simultaneously which apple won by a huge margin. While the M1 chip was able to open and run all the apps within a matter of seconds, the Dell XPS took its time to open those apps and once it did, they were unable to run. Apart from all that, the M1 fan was working efficiently and silently while Dell had overheated and almost hanged.</p><p>When it came to testing the battery life, after 4 hours of intense gaming the Dell had a 7% battery left. The Macbook with M1 was still running at 30%. In benchmark performances, on single-core The M1 was 7% faster yet on multiple cores, the M1 was a whopping 63% faster than i7.</p><p>There is also a $300 price difference between the two with Apple Macbook being the cheaper one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/Intel-i7.png"                      alt="Intel i7"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Apple M1 VS Intel Core-i9</strong></li></ul><p>When it comes to specifications the i9 takes a little of upper-hand in performance, but they also come in much more expensive PCs. Now even with all that, the most surprising aspect was that on Geekbench 5, the Apple M1 still outperformed the i9 on single-core by 23%; however, on multiple cores, the i9 was 19% faster than the new M1.</p><p>Keeping all that in mind, the M1 might still need to catch-up to the i9, but it certainly poses a huge threat for Intel as this is just Apple’s first experiment. One factor that also makes the i9 perform better is that it allows up to 128 GB of memory while the M1 only comes with 8 GB and 16 GB variants.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/Intel-i9.png"                      alt="Intel i9"                ></p><h2 id="What-about-the-Apple-computers-with-Intel-Chips"><a href="#What-about-the-Apple-computers-with-Intel-Chips" class="headerlink" title="What about the Apple computers with Intel Chips?"></a>What about the Apple computers with Intel Chips?</h2><p>The new M1 chip is only available in a limited number of systems as of now and Apple will still be making its PCs using the Intel chip. You’ll now have the option to choose either the M1 variant or the one with an Intel processor. Apple will however move towards installing the M1 chip in all of its Macs if the experiment goes well.</p><h2 id="Is-the-M1-Chip-Good-for-Video-Editing"><a href="#Is-the-M1-Chip-Good-for-Video-Editing" class="headerlink" title="Is the M1 Chip Good for Video Editing?"></a>Is the M1 Chip Good for Video Editing?</h2><p>Definitely yes! The performance of M1 Chip on video editing is quite impressive. It can edit multiple 4-8K videos smoothly, and the rendering is faster than Intel. What you can’t say no to it - it is truly efficient. After conducting several editing tasks, there is still plenty of battery life. The only flaw would be if the video editor does not run natively on the M1 chip, you would not experience that much difference.</p><p><strong>Learn More:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Which Video Editor Works on M1 Chip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Apple has launched the M1 technology that has broken all the barriers of innovation in the personal computer world. It has recently been launched only on MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and MacBook mini, but it is just a test phase which apple is nailing by the way.</p><p>This is the first integrated chip for a personal computer that combines I&#x2F;O, GPU, CPU, and memory together. Compared with its Intel counterparts, the M1 outperforms them by a huge margin. With 16 billion transistors and the highest CPU performance per watt, Apple has outdone itself with its new technology. Although it may have a few drawbacks it is quite new in the market and even in its initial phase, the M1 looks exceedingly promising.</p><p>It would not be an exaggeration to claim this achievement as the setting stone for a new world of technology when it comes to personal computers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/how-to-save-top-cloud-providers-rates/"><u>How to Save  Top Cloud Providers' Rates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/in-2024-bebops-visionary-feathered-future-examined/"><u>In 2024, Bebop's Visionary Feathered Future Examined</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/2024-approved-compre-written-explanation-easy-hdr-understanding/"><u>2024 Approved  Compre Written Explanation  Easy HDR Understanding</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/2024-approved-10-secret-windows-11-tips-and-tricks/"><u>2024 Approved  10 Secret Windows 11 Tips and Tricks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/new-boosting-your-zoom-meetings-chromebook-edition/"><u>[New] Boosting Your Zoom Meetings  Chromebook Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/2024-approved-best-rated-wedding-timekeepers-a-comprehensive-android-and-ios-app-review/"><u>2024 Approved  Best-Rated Wedding Timekeepers  A Comprehensive Android & iOS App Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/updated-achieving-perfection-mastering-sound-with-audacity/"><u>[Updated] Achieving Perfection  Mastering Sound with Audacity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/in-2024-aligning-podcast-drop-dates-with-listener-patterns/"><u>In 2024, Aligning Podcast Drop Dates with Listener Patterns</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/photopony-pro-exploring-affordable-filters/"><u>PhotoPony Pro  Exploring Affordable Filters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/updated-complete-motion-survey-2023/"><u>[Updated] Complete Motion Survey 2023</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/life360-learn-how-everything-works-on-itel-a05s-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Life360 Learn How Everything Works On Itel A05s | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-effortless-keyword-harvesting-explore-the-best-7-no-fee-tag-extractors/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Effortless Keyword Harvesting  Explore the Best 7 No-Fee Tag Extractors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/can-you-watch-mov-movies-on-xiaomi-redmi-k70-by-aiseesoft-video-converter-play-mov-on-android/"><u>Can you watch MOV movies on Xiaomi Redmi K70 ?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-showcasing-your-voice-podcast-features-on-insta/"><u>[Updated] Showcasing Your Voice  Podcast Features on Insta</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-tranquility-trove-pcs-best-bets/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Tranquility Trove  PC's Best Bets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/guidelines-for-upholding-windows-datetime-integrity/"><u>Guidelines for Upholding Windows Date/Time Integrity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/best-fixes-for-infinix-smart-8-hard-reset-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>Best Fixes For Infinix Smart 8 Hard Reset | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/10-best-moba-games-for-android/"><u>10 Best MOBA Games For Android</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-share-twitter-videos-on-facebook/"><u>[Updated] How to Share Twitter Videos on Facebook?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/a-perfect-guide-to-remove-or-disable-google-smart-lock-on-infinix-note-30-vip-racing-edition-by-drfone-android/"><u>A Perfect Guide To Remove or Disable Google Smart Lock On Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Aside from the limited options, one more thing that is worth noting about the current state of VR is the fact that content is limited, as well as the applications. Most of the products available on the market today are targeted towards gamers and mostly exclusive to high-end buyers because of its expensive price.</p><h3 id="The-most-popular-brands-of-VR-headsets-today-is-Oculus-Rift"><a href="#The-most-popular-brands-of-VR-headsets-today-is-Oculus-Rift" class="headerlink" title="The most popular brands of VR headsets today is Oculus Rift"></a>The most popular brands of VR headsets today is Oculus Rift</h3><p><strong>One of the most popular brands of VR headsets today is Oculus Rift, which is also what is used in Samsung Gear VR.</strong> It started from a Kick starter campaign and has now grown into what is the most popular within the product category. It has a powerful resolution and a wide array of advanced features. Another option that is equally popular is the Sony PlayStation VR, which comes with a 5.7-inch OLED display. Google Cardboard, meanwhile, is an option that is similar in terms of effects, but simpler in terms of technology. It uses a simple cardboard with integrated optics to create the VR effect.</p><h3 id="2016-is-going-to-be-a-big-year-for-VR"><a href="#2016-is-going-to-be-a-big-year-for-VR" class="headerlink" title="2016 is going to be a big year for VR"></a>2016 is going to be a big year for VR</h3><p><strong>Deloitte, in one of its researches, have noted that 2016 is going to be a big year for VR,</strong> predicting that it will be a billion dollar industry, with $700 million resulting from hardware sales and the remaining amount from content. By 2020, it is expected that it will be worth more than $14.6 billion. More so, in a report by Goldman Sachs, it has been reiterated that there are more than $3.25 billion in venture capital investments in the VR industry, which is reflective of the high hopes of businesses that it is indeed going to be the next big thing in entertainment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/resource/vr-technology.jpg"                      alt="vr-technology"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Challenges-for-VR"><a href="#Part-2-Challenges-for-VR" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Challenges for VR"></a>Part 2: Challenges for VR</h2><h3 id="Powerful-computers-and-smartphones-will-be-required"><a href="#Powerful-computers-and-smartphones-will-be-required" class="headerlink" title="Powerful computers and smartphones will be required"></a>Powerful computers and smartphones will be required</h3><p> In spite of being full of potential, however, there are also some challenges that should be addressed in order to ensure the success of VR. Among others, one of the most significant would be the need for powerful devices that would complement the headsets. <strong>Powerful computers and smartphones will be required to render the effects that are anticipated.</strong> For Oculus Rift, for instance, a powerful video card is needed for a computer, something you might not have at home, making the VR technology inapplicable.</p><h3 id="VR-design"><a href="#VR-design" class="headerlink" title="VR design"></a>VR design</h3><p> In addition, there are also challenges when it comes to aesthetics. Today’s VR headsets look almost entirely the same – they are bulky, and they look silly. <strong>Manufacturers must find a way in order to make the design more aesthetically-pleasing.</strong></p><h3 id="VR-headsets-should-be-affordable"><a href="#VR-headsets-should-be-affordable" class="headerlink" title="VR headsets should be affordable"></a>VR headsets should be affordable</h3><p><strong>Manufacturers will also be challenged to make VR headsets more affordable</strong> so that more people will be able to purchase it. Most of the models currently available are just too expensive for average buyers.</p><h3 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h3><p> Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, the challenge is to find more applications. It is currently being centered on game-based applications. It has also been recently talked about because of being used for watching porn. Manufacturers are challenged to come up with creative ways in order to increase the usefulness of such a promising device.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Conclusion"><a href="#Part-3-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Conclusion"></a>Part 3: Conclusion</h2><p> In sum, while it is undeniable that VR is big in today’s time, there is a lot of room for improvement. There are limited choices when it comes to VR products available on the market, and for many, it is still a bit expensive. Others lack knowledge on how it works, which results into hesitation. There are also some obstacles that have yet to be addressed and more opportunities to be uncovered. It would be safe to say that it is still in its infancy, but slowly, it is getting to the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/catalog-films-for-streamlined-playback-for-2024/"><u>Catalog Films for Streamlined Playback for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/exploring-windows-hdr-video-features/"><u>Exploring Windows HDR Video Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/2024-approved-crafting-cinematic-magic-a-filmmakers-guide-to-light/"><u>2024 Approved  Crafting Cinematic Magic  A Filmmaker's Guide to Light</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/2024-approved-capturing-stability-mastering-shaky-images/"><u>2024 Approved  Capturing Stability  Mastering Shaky Images</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/2024-approved-chord-and-frame-producing-video-tracks-with-iphones/"><u>2024 Approved  Chord and Frame  Producing Video Tracks with iPhones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/from-srt-to-subc-efficient-conversion-tactics/"><u>From SRT to SUBC  Efficient Conversion Tactics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/ultimate-live-setting-picks/"><u>Ultimate Live Setting Picks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/craft-your-own-film-finale-templates-no-cost/"><u>Craft Your Own Film Finale Templates, No Cost</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/covert-capture-strategies-for-shrouding-personal-info-for-2024/"><u>Covert Capture  Strategies for Shrouding Personal Info for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-optimizing-linkedin-video-thumbnails-a-step-by-step-guide/"><u>New 2024 Approved Optimizing LinkedIn Video Thumbnails A Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-navigating-a-fresh-start-guide-to-altering-your-tiktok-username/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Navigating a Fresh Start  Guide to Altering Your TikTok Username</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/in-2024-prime-audio-cleansing-app-elevate-the-quality-of-your-videos/"><u>In 2024, Prime Audio Cleansing App Elevate the Quality of Your Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/navigate-through-the-top-5-video-extractors-for-fb-on-your-iphoneipad-for-2024/"><u>Navigate Through the Top 5 Video Extractors for FB on Your iPhone/iPad for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/quick-shift-video-techniques-mastering-transitions-for-2024/"><u>Quick-Shift Video Techniques  Mastering Transitions for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/easy-ways-to-manage-your-asus-rog-phone-8-location-settings-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>Easy Ways to Manage Your Asus ROG Phone 8 Location Settings | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/obs-high-encoding-how-to-fix/"><u>OBS High Encoding - How to Fix</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-the-elite-circle-of-digital-titling-top-5-revealed/"><u>[Updated] The Elite Circle of Digital Titling  Top 5 Revealed</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

However, for many users, this is a significant concern.</p><p>After all, faster-paced songs are more engaging and high-energy, invoking feelings of fun and excitement in people. This is one of the reasons why the sped-up songs on videos posted on social media platforms like TikTok are so catchy and shareable.</p><p>If you want a fast-paced song version but not necessarily a pre-made remix with extra effects, manually speeding it up should help**.**</p><p>If that is a concern for you, worry not. This post will detail the best solutions and software to <strong>speed up music on Spotify</strong> using its rich library of songs, with steps. Let’s continue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/a-comprehensive-analysis-on-how-to-speed-up-audio-files-on-spotify-safely-1.jpg"                      alt="image of spotify app"                ></p><h2 id="Part-I-How-to-Speed-Up-Songs-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-I-How-to-Speed-Up-Songs-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part I. How to Speed Up Songs on Spotify?"></a>Part I. How to Speed Up Songs on Spotify?</h2><p>Firstly, consider if the process of <strong>changing a song’s speed on Spotify</strong> is directly applicable to the platform. The answer to that is no. As of the time of this writing, Spotify or any of the well-known online audio streaming sites still need to offer the music playback speed adjustment feature. This applies to both web and mobile versions while streaming songs.</p><p>While there is no direct function for adjusting Spotify songs or even podcasts’ playback speed, you can use the <a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spotify-playback-speed-ac/cgbihpjbhpdfbdckcabcniojdhcgblhd" >Spotify Playback Speed Access <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of Spotify Web Player. This is a Google Chrome extension that allows users the ability to <strong>speed up Spotify songs</strong>, mainly on the web app version.</p><p>However, this extension was last updated in October 2019. So, while using it, you might notice some issues.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Change-Playback-Speed-on-Spotify-Web-Player"><a href="#Method-1-Change-Playback-Speed-on-Spotify-Web-Player" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Change Playback Speed on Spotify Web Player"></a>Method 1: Change Playback Speed on Spotify Web Player</h3><p>The following are the main steps you should follow to <strong>Spotify speed up music via the Spotify Web Player:</strong></p><p>Step1: Go to Google Chrome Web Store and search for the Spotify Playback Speed Access extension.</p><p>Step2: Tap the “Add to Chrome” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/a-comprehensive-analysis-on-how-to-speed-up-audio-files-on-spotify-safely-2.jpg"                      alt="tap the add to chrome button"                ></p><p>Step3: Access the Spotify web player on your device and access the Spotify account by logging in.</p><p>Step4: Tap on the triangle icon and increase&#x2F;decrease the playback speed of the songs while listening.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/a-comprehensive-analysis-on-how-to-speed-up-audio-files-on-spotify-safely-3.jpg"                      alt="tap on the triangle icon"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Speed-Up-Slow-Down-Audio-Files-on-Spotify-App"><a href="#Method-2-Speed-Up-Slow-Down-Audio-Files-on-Spotify-App" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Speed Up&#x2F;Slow Down Audio Files on Spotify App"></a>Method 2: Speed Up&#x2F;Slow Down Audio Files on Spotify App</h3><p>It is also possible to <strong>slow down the music app Spotify</strong> using the solution, but mainly for podcasts, not songs. Here are the main steps for the process.</p><p><strong>For mobile users:</strong></p><p>Step1: Open the Spotify app on your smartphone &gt; choose a podcast.</p><p>Step2: When the audio starts playing, you can click the Change Speed button at the bottom-left side of the screen. Choose your preferred speed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/a-comprehensive-analysis-on-how-to-speed-up-audio-files-on-spotify-safely-4.jpg"                      alt="click the change speed button"                ></p><p><strong>For Desktop users:</strong></p><p>Step1: Access the Spotify app through your desktop device. Open a podcast and start playing an episode.</p><p>Step2: Click on the Change Speed icon with 1x marks. Tap on it to choose your preferred audio speed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/a-comprehensive-analysis-on-how-to-speed-up-audio-files-on-spotify-safely-5.jpg"                      alt="choose the preferred audio speed"                ></p><h2 id="Part-II-How-to-Change-Speed-of-Audio-on-Spotify-for-Further-Video-Editing-Full-Guide"><a href="#Part-II-How-to-Change-Speed-of-Audio-on-Spotify-for-Further-Video-Editing-Full-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Part II. How to Change Speed of Audio on Spotify for Further Video Editing- Full Guide"></a>Part II. How to Change Speed of Audio on Spotify for Further Video Editing- Full Guide</h2><p>When it comes to Spotify and its users, many utilize the software for more than just music playback or listening to podcasts. Some users require songs from worldwide creators available on Spotify for video editing. This is because of the vast library of high-quality music types on the software.</p><p>Adding a soundtrack to the video can favorably enhance scenes in videos, like a romantic tune for a honeymoon video or catchy tunes for product promotion projects. So, to <strong>change the song’s speed, Spotify</strong> users should know the steps and use the appropriate software to download the music for video-based editing.</p><p>It is possible to do so in two phases- downloading the songs offline using specific apps on different platforms. Then, you must utilize high-quality video editing software to apply it to the video of your choice. Let’s discuss the steps for both.</p><h5 id="Step1Download-the-music-from-Spotify"><a href="#Step1Download-the-music-from-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Step1Download the music from Spotify"></a>Step1Download the music from Spotify</h5><p>The first level related to <strong>Spotify speeding up songs</strong> for video editing is getting the audio track from the Spotify library. Currently, it is not possible for users to download the songs on this platform for an offline user via the app, especially with a free account. However, there are other tools and versions available.</p><h5 id="On-Desktop-Using-Musify"><a href="#On-Desktop-Using-Musify" class="headerlink" title="On Desktop - Using Musify"></a>On Desktop - Using Musify</h5><p>Musify is a valuable software for Mac and Windows users to download songs from Spotify on desktops.

In addition, gaming monitors are a completely new concept for many console owners. It was easy to choose a 4K TV with Xbox One, but we experienced some interesting alternatives when the next generation came along.</p><p>As console owners gravitate toward monitors in order to take advantage of the incredible framerates and resolutions the Xbox Series X can deliver, the pull of monitors appears to be increasing. Let’s check out some of our top picks for the best monitors for Xbox Series X, and keep in mind that HDMI 2.1 monitors are on the way, so if you’re interested in seeing what’s coming, please head over to our top picks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/xbox-seriesx.jpg"                      alt="xbox-seriesx"                ></p><h4 id="Using-a-monitor-with-Xbox-Series-X"><a href="#Using-a-monitor-with-Xbox-Series-X" class="headerlink" title="Using a monitor with Xbox Series X"></a><strong>Using a monitor with Xbox Series X</strong></h4><p>The best way to enjoy Xbox Series X is to get a monitor that supports either 8K at 60hz or 4K at 120hz, which means that you’ll need an HDMI 2.1 monitor. In spite of the fact that there are some amazing HDMI 2.1 cable options out there, HDMI 2.1 monitors are not as common as they could be at this moment, but we expect them to appear soon.</p><p>Accordingly, the most common monitor options available for Xbox Series X gamers as of right now are 1080p at 120Hz, 1440p at 120Hz, or 4K at 60Hz. Even though 120hz gaming doesn’t require an HDMI 2.1 monitor, one popular approach involves lowering the resolution while increasing framerates. The ability to play either racing or FPS games at 1080p at 120Hz would be an example of this.</p><hr><p><strong>You might be interested in:</strong></p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Monitors For Your ps5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best TVs You Can Find in 2024 for ps5 and Xbox Series X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><p><strong>Our Top Picks For Best Xbox Series X Monitors</strong></p><h4 id="1-Samsung-Odyssey-G7-32-Inch"><a href="#1-Samsung-Odyssey-G7-32-Inch" class="headerlink" title="1.

People like me who work as freelancers or in different companies now use Zoom for numerous work calls and daily virtual meets. It doesn’t matter if you have a laptop or a smartphone you can put Zoom to use anytime.</p><p>So if you have a query, “is Zoom in android actually a thing?” and if you are new to Zoom, don’t know how to start or join a Zoom meeting on Android, and how to schedule it, this step-wise process will help you out. So before making that Zoom call, here is everything you must understand and be aware of:</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Join Zoom meeting using the Zoom URL on Android</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Join Zoom meetings using a Zoom ID on Android</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">How to Schedule a Zoom Meeting Android</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Start-a-Zoom-Meeting-on-Android"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Start-a-Zoom-Meeting-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

All the features are pretty visible and can be used with ease. Also, the phone camera is much better in quality and hence, you can make calls with better visibility of yourself to whom you have called. You just have to opt for downloading the Zoom app by using the Google Play Store. Then you can opt for the creation of an account and you can put Zoom to use right away. Here’s how you get started with a meeting using Zoom on an Android phone:</p><ul><li>On the left side, in the upper corner, opt for clicking on the option “<strong>New Meeting.</strong>“</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/schedule-zoom-meeting-android-1.jpg"                      alt="new zoom meeting android"                ></p><ul><li>Now, opt for the selection of “<strong>Start a Meeting.</strong>“ Once done, you will notice a video conference space.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/schedule-zoom-meeting-android-2.jpg"                      alt="start a zoom meeting android"                ></p><ul><li>At this point, you will see a pop-up with the “<strong>Got it</strong>“ button on it. Click on it so you can provide a permit to Zoom to access the microphone and camera of the device you are using.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/schedule-zoom-meeting-android-3.jpg"                      alt="zoom access permission android"                ></p><ul><li>Now, you will see a window pop-up asking you to provide access to Zoom to record a video or click a picture. Click on the button “<strong>Allow</strong>“</li><li>Now, at this point, the screen of your device will have the option “<strong>Participants,</strong>“. This option you can opt to use for the addition of one or more people to your meeting.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/schedule-zoom-meeting-android-4.jpg"                      alt="allow more participants"                ></p><ul><li>Now, opt for clicking on “<strong>Invite</strong>“. Here, after this, you will see a menu. This menu will have a few options you can choose from so you can send guest invites. Also, using Zoom’s contacts option, you may invite people by sending an email or sharing the invite link, and so on. So it’s pretty simple to use in that sense.</li><li>Now, you have to press “<strong>Send Email</strong>“ by putting everyone’s email address and now, click on the “<strong>Send</strong>“ button.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/schedule-zoom-meeting-android-5.jpg"                      alt="send email zoom meeting"                ></p><p>Also, when it comes to copying the meeting’s hyperlink, you can opt to tap on the “<strong>Copy invite link</strong>“ option on your device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Join-an-existing-Zoom-Meeting-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Join-an-existing-Zoom-Meeting-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Join an existing Zoom Meeting on Android"></a>Part 2.

How to Start a Zoom Meeting on Android</p><p>There is no doubt that the Zoom app on an android device is easy to navigate through and put to use. All the features are pretty visible and can be used with ease. Also, the phone camera is much better in quality and hence, you can make calls with better visibility of yourself to whom you have called. You just have to opt for downloading the Zoom app by using the Google Play Store. Then you can opt for the creation of an account and you can put Zoom to use right away. Here’s how you get started with a meeting using Zoom on an Android phone:</p><ul><li>On the left side, in the upper corner, opt for clicking on the option “<strong>New Meeting.</strong>“</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/schedule-zoom-meeting-android-1.jpg"                      alt="new zoom meeting android"                ></p><ul><li>Now, opt for the selection of “<strong>Start a Meeting.</strong>“ Once done, you will notice a video conference space.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/schedule-zoom-meeting-android-2.jpg"                      alt="start a zoom meeting android"                ></p><ul><li>At this point, you will see a pop-up with the “<strong>Got it</strong>“ button on it. Click on it so you can provide a permit to Zoom to access the microphone and camera of the device you are using.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/schedule-zoom-meeting-android-3.jpg"                      alt="zoom access permission android"                ></p><ul><li>Now, you will see a window pop-up asking you to provide access to Zoom to record a video or click a picture. Click on the button “<strong>Allow</strong>“</li><li>Now, at this point, the screen of your device will have the option “<strong>Participants,</strong>“. This option you can opt to use for the addition of one or more people to your meeting.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/schedule-zoom-meeting-android-4.jpg"                      alt="allow more participants"                ></p><ul><li>Now, opt for clicking on “<strong>Invite</strong>“. Here, after this, you will see a menu. This menu will have a few options you can choose from so you can send guest invites. Also, using Zoom’s contacts option, you may invite people by sending an email or sharing the invite link, and so on. So it’s pretty simple to use in that sense.</li><li>Now, you have to press “<strong>Send Email</strong>“ by putting everyone’s email address and now, click on the “<strong>Send</strong>“ button.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/schedule-zoom-meeting-android-5.jpg"                      alt="send email zoom meeting"                ></p><p>Also, when it comes to copying the meeting’s hyperlink, you can opt to tap on the “<strong>Copy invite link</strong>“ option on your device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Join-an-existing-Zoom-Meeting-on-Android-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Join-an-existing-Zoom-Meeting-on-Android-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.
