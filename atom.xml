It’s one of the world’s most extensive podcast streaming services. So how did it get there? And how can you get on the platform yourself?</p><p>This article dives deep into Apple’s podcast strategy. It includes how to submit to Apple Podcasts, why you should and how to improve your chances of getting on the platform.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Prepare-Your-Show-for-Apple-Podcast-Submission"><a href="#Part-1-Prepare-Your-Show-for-Apple-Podcast-Submission" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

Prepare Your Show for Apple Podcast Submission</h2><p>Apple Podcasts submission is an excellent opportunity to earn severe exposure to your podcast. It would be best to start by sending your show to Apple for review. Then, we’ll help you with the steps to get your podcast accepted on Apple Podcasts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Apple Podcasts is not a podcast-hosting site.

Here are some requirements for an RSS feed from Apple:</p><ul><li>Show artwork and allow streaming playback of your episodes.</li><li>RSS feed URLs must be publicly addressable.</li><li>Only ASCII filenames and URLs.</li><li>All episodes must contain a GUID, which never changes.</li><li>Each episode must have a unique <enclosure> tag and its three required components — URL, length, and type.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-Why-Get-Feed-Validation-Errors"><a href="#Part-3-Why-Get-Feed-Validation-Errors" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Why Get Feed Validation Errors?"></a>Part 3. Why Get Feed Validation Errors?</h2><p>Validation errors occur when the RSS feed isn’t formatted correctly or contains something it shouldn’t.</p><h3 id="Invalid-characters"><a href="#Invalid-characters" class="headerlink" title="Invalid characters"></a>Invalid characters</h3><p>An invalid feed is often caused by one or more “invalid” characters that need to be removed or edited—for example, using a series of dashes “-“ in the description to create a line break or an episode file that contains characters other than 0-1, a-z, or A-Z.</p><h3 id="Formatted-incorrect"><a href="#Formatted-incorrect" class="headerlink" title="Formatted incorrect"></a>Formatted incorrect</h3><p>An episode file uploaded using a file type that isn’t supported by Apple Podcasts and other podcast listening platforms. We recommend uploading audio files as MP3 files and video episodes as MP4 files.</p><p>Well, there are two ways to reach the root cause:</p><ul><li>Troubleshoot a failed validation by external tools. There are many to choose from, like Cast Feed Validator and Podbase Podcast Validator.</li><li>Get help from hosting providers. We suggest checking your hosting provider’s support forums or contacting the original hosting platform for assistance. They usually provide service with setting up RSS feeds.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-4-Best-Practices-for-Submitting-a-Podcast-to-Apple-Podcasts"><a href="#Part-4-Best-Practices-for-Submitting-a-Podcast-to-Apple-Podcasts" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Best Practices for Submitting a Podcast to Apple Podcasts"></a>Part 4. Best Practices for Submitting a Podcast to Apple Podcasts</h2><p>Your podcast submission may seem like a hassle at first, but once you have all of your materials organized and submitted, it will be much easier. By following these best practices for submitting a podcast to Apple Podcasts, you’ll be well on your way to achieving podcasting success.</p><h3 id="Fill-out-RSS-feed-data"><a href="#Fill-out-RSS-feed-data" class="headerlink" title="Fill out RSS feed data"></a>Fill out RSS feed data</h3><p>One big mistake people make when filling out RSS feed data is failing to do so. The problem is that many RSS readers can only read the feeds you have specified. Therefore, if you do not fill out all the required fields, it will not show up to your reader.</p><p>That is the most important practice you need to do. Make sure you put the data that Apple Podcasts requires in there.</p><h3 id="Compelling-description"><a href="#Compelling-description" class="headerlink" title="Compelling description"></a>Compelling description</h3><p>The description of your podcast is one of the first things people see, and it’s also one of the last things people see before downloading. For a listener to give the episode a second look, they first need to know that it’s something they should listen to. Therefore, it would be best to make a compelling description to convince someone to listen to your show.</p><p>Some basic rules of thumb for writing a good description:</p><ul><li>Include a clear subject line.</li><li>Introduce your topic.</li><li>Explain how the episode relates to the rest of your show.</li></ul><h3 id="Bold-cover-art"><a href="#Bold-cover-art" class="headerlink" title="Bold cover art"></a>Bold cover art</h3><p>A simple way to add personality to your podcast is by using bold cover art. It shows that you care about the quality of your audio content, and the image communicates your message. The cover art should be proactive and distinctive but subtle enough not to distract from the show itself.</p><p>Remember that most people use mobile devices to browse podcasts. That means your cover art must be easily readable on small screens. So having minimal text with large fonts is the best option.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Apple has been criticized by podcasters who claim that Apple’s podcast submission process is complex, confusing, and challenging to navigate.

Here are some requirements for an RSS feed from Apple:</p><ul><li>Show artwork and allow streaming playback of your episodes.</li><li>RSS feed URLs must be publicly addressable.</li><li>Only ASCII filenames and URLs.</li><li>All episodes must contain a GUID, which never changes.</li><li>Each episode must have a unique <enclosure> tag and its three required components — URL, length, and type.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-Why-Get-Feed-Validation-Errors-1"><a href="#Part-3-Why-Get-Feed-Validation-Errors-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Why Get Feed Validation Errors?"></a>Part 3. Why Get Feed Validation Errors?</h2><p>Validation errors occur when the RSS feed isn’t formatted correctly or contains something it shouldn’t.</p><h3 id="Invalid-characters-1"><a href="#Invalid-characters-1" class="headerlink" title="Invalid characters"></a>Invalid characters</h3><p>An invalid feed is often caused by one or more “invalid” characters that need to be removed or edited—for example, using a series of dashes “-“ in the description to create a line break or an episode file that contains characters other than 0-1, a-z, or A-Z.</p><h3 id="Formatted-incorrect-1"><a href="#Formatted-incorrect-1" class="headerlink" title="Formatted incorrect"></a>Formatted incorrect</h3><p>An episode file uploaded using a file type that isn’t supported by Apple Podcasts and other podcast listening platforms. We recommend uploading audio files as MP3 files and video episodes as MP4 files.</p><p>Well, there are two ways to reach the root cause:</p><ul><li>Troubleshoot a failed validation by external tools. There are many to choose from, like Cast Feed Validator and Podbase Podcast Validator.</li><li>Get help from hosting providers. We suggest checking your hosting provider’s support forums or contacting the original hosting platform for assistance. They usually provide service with setting up RSS feeds.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-4-Best-Practices-for-Submitting-a-Podcast-to-Apple-Podcasts-1"><a href="#Part-4-Best-Practices-for-Submitting-a-Podcast-to-Apple-Podcasts-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Best Practices for Submitting a Podcast to Apple Podcasts"></a>Part 4. Best Practices for Submitting a Podcast to Apple Podcasts</h2><p>Your podcast submission may seem like a hassle at first, but once you have all of your materials organized and submitted, it will be much easier. By following these best practices for submitting a podcast to Apple Podcasts, you’ll be well on your way to achieving podcasting success.</p><h3 id="Fill-out-RSS-feed-data-1"><a href="#Fill-out-RSS-feed-data-1" class="headerlink" title="Fill out RSS feed data"></a>Fill out RSS feed data</h3><p>One big mistake people make when filling out RSS feed data is failing to do so. The problem is that many RSS readers can only read the feeds you have specified. Therefore, if you do not fill out all the required fields, it will not show up to your reader.</p><p>That is the most important practice you need to do. Make sure you put the data that Apple Podcasts requires in there.</p><h3 id="Compelling-description-1"><a href="#Compelling-description-1" class="headerlink" title="Compelling description"></a>Compelling description</h3><p>The description of your podcast is one of the first things people see, and it’s also one of the last things people see before downloading. For a listener to give the episode a second look, they first need to know that it’s something they should listen to. Therefore, it would be best to make a compelling description to convince someone to listen to your show.</p><p>Some basic rules of thumb for writing a good description:</p><ul><li>Include a clear subject line.</li><li>Introduce your topic.</li><li>Explain how the episode relates to the rest of your show.</li></ul><h3 id="Bold-cover-art-1"><a href="#Bold-cover-art-1" class="headerlink" title="Bold cover art"></a>Bold cover art</h3><p>A simple way to add personality to your podcast is by using bold cover art. It shows that you care about the quality of your audio content, and the image communicates your message. The cover art should be proactive and distinctive but subtle enough not to distract from the show itself.</p><p>Remember that most people use mobile devices to browse podcasts. That means your cover art must be easily readable on small screens. So having minimal text with large fonts is the best option.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Apple has been criticized by podcasters who claim that Apple’s podcast submission process is complex, confusing, and challenging to navigate. So that’s where we come in.</p><p>This article discusses what it takes to get featured on the Apple Podcasts podcast directory. We discuss what it means to get featured on Apple Podcasts, why you should be submitting your show, and why it’s worth it.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/new-essential-tools-for-motion-artwork-for-2024/"><u>[New] Essential Tools for Motion Artwork for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-expressive-communicator-investigation-edition-8-for-2024/"><u>[New] Expressive Communicator Investigation, Edition 8 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-morphvox-mastery-complete-technique-collection/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved MorphVOX Mastery Complete Technique Collection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/updated-bright-beginnings-quick-ways-to-brighten-iphone-clips-and-more/"><u>[Updated] Bright Beginnings Quick Ways to Brighten iPhone Clips and More</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/updated-comparing-the-best-gopro-max-360-vs-hero-11/"><u>[Updated] Comparing the Best GoPro Max 360 VS Hero 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/2024-approved-compile-of-premier-iphone-camera-apps-for-pro-photographers/"><u>2024 Approved Compile of Premier iPhone Camera Apps for Pro Photographers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/5-ways-to-transfer-files-to-your-computer/"><u>5 Ways To Transfer Files To Your Computer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-a-realme-narzo-n55-easily-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Unlock a Realme Narzo N55 Easily?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/in-2024-clearer-view-deeper-insight-zoom-techniques-in-videoleap/"><u>In 2024, Clearer View, Deeper Insight Zoom Techniques in Videoleap</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/in-2024-crafting-cinematic-audio-in-inshot-videos/"><u>In 2024, Crafting Cinematic Audio in InShot Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-bypass-activation-lock-on-apple-watch-or-iphone-xs-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How To Bypass Activation Lock On Apple Watch Or iPhone XS?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/24-perfect-pick-the-best-microphones-for-all-yt-content-types/"><u>In 2024, Perfect Pick The Best Microphones For All YT Content Types</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-updated-method-to-bypass-honor-100-frp-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, The Updated Method to Bypass Honor 100 FRP</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-tips-and-tricks-for-perfect-tweets-with-videos/"><u>In 2024, Tips and Tricks for Perfect Tweets with Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-lip-sync-experience-5-must-try-apps-for-2024/"><u>New The Ultimate Lip Sync Experience 5 Must-Try Apps for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-download.techidaily.com/secure-and-rapid-download-of-your-ft232r-usb-uart-driver-expert-tips-inside/"><u>Secure and Rapid Download of Your FT232R USB UART Driver: Expert Tips Inside</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/the-best-in-storytelling-eight-film-genre-showcase/"><u>The Best in Storytelling Eight Film Genre Showcase</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-copying-imagesvideos-between-iphones/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Copying Images/Videos Between iPhones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/xmedia-center-all-in-one-windows-alternative/"><u>XMedia Center All-in-One Windows Alternative</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

AR Stands for augmented reality - a technology that combines the real world and digital content. You can use it to make fun images and videos. But how do you use this feature? And are there options for people without a Google Pixel phone?</p><p>In this article, we will take a look at this feature. Also, we will show you a great alternative that lets you experience the same but using other devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-ar-stickers-its-alternative.gif"                      alt="google ar stickers and its alternative"                ></p><h2 id="What-Is-Google-AR-Sticker"><a href="#What-Is-Google-AR-Sticker" class="headerlink" title="What Is Google AR Sticker?"></a>What Is Google AR Sticker?</h2><p>Think of stickers that you can put on images or videos. However, these stickers are in 3D. Furthermore, they look like they are actually in the environment or they are a part of your body. However, you can only see them through a camera lens.</p><p>You can look at Pokemon Go to understand it better. The game allows you to “place” your Pokemon in the real world and take photos of them. Google AR stickers are like that, except the stickers are not strictly only Pokemon. There are letters, food, Stranger Things characters, and more!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://homestyler.sjv.io/c/5597632/1943647/22993" target="_top" id="1943647">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1943647" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://homestyler.sjv.io/i/5597632/1943647/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="History-of-Google-AR-Sticker"><a href="#History-of-Google-AR-Sticker" class="headerlink" title="History of Google AR Sticker"></a>History of Google AR Sticker</h2><p>Back in 2017, virtual reality and augmented reality received an increase in interest. While these technologies weren’t really new, it was at this time that they became common. Apps like Snapchat included AR stickers that allowed users to take photos and videos with their favorite fictional characters and such. Google hopped on the trend by incorporating AR stickers into its smartphone, Pixel 2.</p><p>The thing is that it did not last long. Ever since Google launched its Pixel 4a in 2020, they no longer provided AR stickers. The camera of the new devices is not compatible with AR stickers, Playground, and Playmoji. And that’s the end of Google AR Stickers.</p><p>Owners of older Pixel models should not worry since the devices’ hardware isn’t changed. Thus, they will continue to support Playground, the app needed to use Google AR Stickers.</p><h2 id="How-To-Use-Google-Playground-AR-Stickers-on-Pixel-4-and-Earlier"><a href="#How-To-Use-Google-Playground-AR-Stickers-on-Pixel-4-and-Earlier" class="headerlink" title="How To Use Google Playground AR Stickers on Pixel 4 and Earlier"></a>How To Use Google Playground AR Stickers on Pixel 4 and Earlier</h2><p>As mentioned above, older Pixel models still have Google Playground support. These devices are Pixel 4 and earlier. Meanwhile, Playmojis (3D AR Stickers) are available only for Pixel 3, 3a, and 4.</p><p>Here’s a step-by-step tutorial on how to use this feature:</p><p>Step1 Ensure you have Android 8.1 (Oreo) installed on your Pixel. Also, ensure the Google Camera app is updated.</p><p>Step2 Launch the Google Camera app.</p><p>Step3 Tap **”**More” &gt; “Playground.”</p><p>Step4 Select “Stickers” &gt; “Playmoji” or “Stickers.”</p><p>Step5 Tap the AR Sticker or Playmoji that you want to use.</p><p>Step6 Touch and hold, and drag the AR sticker where you want it to be on the photo or video. Adjust the sticker as needed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-ar-stickers-6.jpg"                      alt="dragging star wars sticker to camera screen"                ></p><p>Step7 Tap “Capture” to take a photo.

It’s understandable since “augmented reality” sounds very advanced and complex. Here are some FAQs about it to make you more informed about the subject.</p><p><strong>Q1. What Are AR Stickers?</strong></p><p>AR stickers are augmented reality image effects you can add to improve photos or videos. They can be static images or animations. Some examples are eyeglasses, bunny headbands, hats, beards, or even animals or characters.</p><p>The application that offers it maps your face or the environment in the video and tracks movements.

Can You Use AR Without an App?</strong></p><p>Perhaps you don’t want to install custom AR apps. That’s not new. According to some studies, engagement drops by 50% when users need to download. So, some developers chose the WebAR path instead.</p><p>WebAR uses web technologies to let users experience augmented reality. All you need is a phone or any device with a camera and a web browser.

Are AR Apps Safe?</strong></p><p>AR Apps can be dangerous, but not all of them are. Keep in mind that AR apps can see what you are doing in real-time. If that information falls into the wrong hands, you may end up in trouble.</p><p>Vendors can also add malware or other things to the apps. So it’s necessary that you always stay vigilant. As much as possible, download AR apps from vendors with a good reputation.

Even though the obvious solution to the shortcomings of 4K monitors lies in getting displays that have higher resolutions, 5K monitors are still not widely accepted by professionals across different industries. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through some of the best 5K monitors you can buy.</p><h2 id="What’s-5K-Resolution"><a href="#What’s-5K-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="What’s 5K Resolution?"></a>What’s 5K Resolution?</h2><p>Before we take a look at different models of 5K monitors, we are going to take a moment to shed some light on what 5K resolution actually is. The exact resolution of 5K monitors that have 16:9 aspect ratios can vary slightly depending on the model, but the most common 5K resolution is 5120X2880 or 14.7 million pixels.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5k-high-resolution.jpg"                      alt="5k high resolution "                ></p><p>This means that 5K monitors offer 33.33% more pixels on both horizontal and vertical sides than 4K monitors. This extra space can be useful to video editors who want to view 4K footage at native resolution while still being able to see the interface of the app they are using to process it.</p><p>As <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4K <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> content is growing more popular, 5K monitors are becoming more useful, which might make them more available on the markets around the globe in the next few years. However, 5K resolution is still not a standard digital cinematography format in 2024, since most video content creators opt to shoot their footage in Full HD or 4K resolution.</p><h2 id="8-Best-5K-Monitors-for-PC-and-Mac-Computers"><a href="#8-Best-5K-Monitors-for-PC-and-Mac-Computers" class="headerlink" title="8 Best 5K Monitors for PC and Mac Computers"></a>8 Best 5K Monitors for PC and Mac Computers</h2><p>It has been a little over five years since the first 5K monitors hit the market, but even after all this time, the model selection is still scarce. Even so, nearly all 5K monitors are capable of stunning performances regardless of the purpose for which they are used. So, let’s take a look at the 8 best 5K monitors for PC and Mac computers you can buy in 2024.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1001453/11832" target="_top" id="1001453">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1001453" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1001453/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-LG-34WK95U-W-34’’-UltraWide-5K2K-Monitor"><a href="#1-LG-34WK95U-W-34’’-UltraWide-5K2K-Monitor" class="headerlink" title="1.

However, you shouldn’t expect the same performances that pricier models of 5K monitors provide. In addition to a relatively complicated calibration process, the Iiyama ProLite XB2779QQS struggles to depict colors accurately even if you manage to calibrate it properly.</p><p>This 16:9 aspect ratio monitor looks a bit outdated as its thick bothers resemble monitor models from the early 2010s. Even though you can adjust the height, tilt or swivel of this monitor, its stand lacks stability, which is why it much better to mount it on the wall. Even so, Iiyama ProLite XB2779QQS is a budget-friendly option that provides solid picture quality to all of its users, while its fast response time and excellent native contrast make it an intriguing choice for creative industry professionals.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Less expensive than the competition</li><li>Wide viewing angles</li><li>No flickering</li><li>Fast response times</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>No HDR support</li><li>Doesn’t have USB hubs</li></ul><p>4.   <strong>Planar IX2790</strong></p><p>**Best for:**Common use</p><p>**Price:**Available upon request, $788,16 on Amazon</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vplanar-5k-monitor.jpg"                      alt="Planar 5K monitor "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1972679/19272" target="_top" id="1972679">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1972679" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1972679/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Even though Planar is not one of the most recognizable names on the 5K monitor market, its IX2790 model provides excellent performances at a reasonable price. This bezel-free IPS LCD 5K monitor is modernly designed, and it fits perfectly to the office and any other working environment. All of the function buttons are located on the bottom bar so that you can access them quickly, but you must use them carefully as they are touch-sensitive. The wide horizontal and vertical viewing angle, as well as stunning color accuracy, make Planar IX2790 suitable for use in a broad range of contexts. However, professional video editors, graphic designers, and artists who work with digital images shouldn’t expect high-end performances more expensive 5K monitors can provide. Moreover, the monitor’s stand offers only modest tilting and height adjustment options, which is why it is much easier to mount IX2790 onto a wall.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Versatile monitor that can be used for a broad range of purposes</li><li>Wide horizontal and vertical viewing angle</li><li>Displays colors accurately</li><li>Moderately priced</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Limited connection capabilities</li><li>Poor audio quality</li></ul><h3 id="5-Dell-U4919DW"><a href="#5-Dell-U4919DW" class="headerlink" title="5.

This recently released curved ultrawide monitor has a 32:9 aspect ratio and a 5120x1440 resolution that guarantees high image quality. The panel has an anti-glare finish that eliminates reflections and a wide viewing angle that allows you to see images accurately from virtually any angle.</p><p>This model requires minimum calibration as it ships with 99% sRGB factory calibration at Delta E less than 2. The VESA-compatible mount grants you complete freedom so that you can tilt, swivel or adjust the monitor’s height in any way you want. The U4919DW’s connection options are equally impressive since this 5K monitor features a DisplayPort, two HDMI ports and several USB upstream and downstream ports.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Designed to facilitate creativity</li><li>Fast response times</li><li>Huge screen size</li><li>Excellent connectivity capabilities</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Doesn’t offer support for HDR</li><li>No built-in speakers</li></ul><h3 id="6-Philips-499P9H"><a href="#6-Philips-499P9H" class="headerlink" title="6.

Philips 499P9H also offers HRD support and it has a minimum input lag, which means that you can use it for gaming purposes.

But make sure that it is neat enough and has a broad field of vision. Moreover, there is no exposure to it.</p><p>It will be best to choose one that can easily match any color.

But make sure that it is neat enough and has a broad field of vision. Moreover, there is no exposure to it.</p><p>It will be best to choose one that can easily match any color. But remember, do not use pure white backgrounds as they are too reflective, which is not suitable for the vision of your stream as it affects the highlight of the streamer and the products very much.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/best-backgrounds-for-live-streaming-1.jpg"                      alt="pure color background"                ></p><h3 id="2-Neatly-organized-shelves-1"><a href="#2-Neatly-organized-shelves-1" class="headerlink" title="2.

For example, you can set a bookshelf as your background if you have to join some live business meetings or academic sessions.</p><p>Even if you are a seller showcasing his products during a live stream, you can select this type of background by placing the products you will introduce on any clean shelf. It will help you to make the viewer experience much better.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/best-backgrounds-for-live-streaming-2.jpg"                      alt="neatly organized shelves"                ></p><h3 id="3-The-real-scene-with-warm-decoration-1"><a href="#3-The-real-scene-with-warm-decoration-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

They make your relationship with the viewers much more friendly and familiar. In other words, they give your stream a natural look, which fascinates the viewers very much.</p><p>One thing you guys should never forget is that you have to decorate the scene according to your stream category and characteristics.

Using this feature, you can change your background anytime with any beautiful wallpaper or image you want. They can give your viewers a better visual appearance and a trustful impression. That is why live streams are also very important for large businesses.</p><p>Also, there are two kinds of virtual backgrounds. The first is a static image in which you can directly upload the wallpaper you want. The second option is the green screen, which is preferable to the latter.

This editor supports a broad range of photo file formats and it is capable of processing thousands of images in just a couple of minutes. However, it lacks advanced watermarking and photo editing tools, so enhancing the colors in a photo or creating watermark templates is not possible with Alamoon Watermark app. The professional version of this watermarking software is largely overpriced and there are more powerful and more affordable options available.</p><h4 id="8-Star-Watermark"><a href="#8-Star-Watermark" class="headerlink" title="8. Star Watermark"></a>8. <a class="link"   href="https://www.star-watermark.com/" >Star Watermark <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free version available, pricing plans start at $17 for a lifetime license</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows</p><p>Customizing each watermark you create with this cross-platform app is a straightforward process that won’t take more than a few minutes of your time. You can easily alter the size of the text, change its color, add shadows or position the text anywhere in the photo. Star Watermark enables its users to use images as watermarks or even create multilayered watermarks. The batch processing features, however, remain one of the most common reasons why professional photographers opt to use the Star Watermark software. Unfortunately, the app doesn’t offer any of the advanced watermarking features, and it doesn’t allow you to use your digital signature as a watermark.</p><h4 id="9-Visual-Watermark"><a href="#9-Visual-Watermark" class="headerlink" title="9. Visual Watermark"></a>9. <a class="link"   href="https://www.visualwatermark.com/" >Visual Watermark <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, pricing plans start at $19.95 for a lifetime license</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows, Android</p><p>The Visual Watermark software makes watermarking hundreds of photos in a short period of time look easy. Besides watermarking photos, you can also use the Visual Watermark application to add watermarks to videos. There are 260 fonts available, but you can also import your own custom-made fonts and use them to create watermarks. The software adjusts the size and the position of the watermark to each photo automatically, but you can also fine-tune each of these settings manually. Most importantly, the Visual Watermark software protects your images from artificial intelligence algorithms that remove watermarks from photos automatically by making minor changes to the template you’re applying to the photos you’re processing.</p><h4 id="10-Water-Marquee"><a href="#10-Water-Marquee" class="headerlink" title="10. Water Marquee"></a>10. <a class="link"   href="https://www.watermarquee.com/" >Water Marquee <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Web-based</p><p>This online watermarking tool enables you to create your own watermarks or use fully customizable templates to protect your images.

You can then proceed to insert the text, select its size, color or font and decide if you want to use a solid or transparent background.

Prefer to get the latest version, it is easily available over internet and can be downloaded and installed by beginners too. Once your software tool is ready on your system then proceed ahead.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First of all you need to save your video and subtitle file with same name.

This software is easily available in 32, 64 bit versions so you can easily access any of these. Simply install codec from this source; no need to work on configuration settings. Note that these codecs must be installed from a trusted source so that malware or virus attacks can be avoided.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once you are done with step 3 then download Sharkoo7’s Advanced Codec from internet. Get it installed for Window Media Player and then open with 64 bit settings or 32 bit as per your device specifications. To open it, simply right click on icon and from drop down menu choose “Run as administrator”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subtitle-wmp-3.jpg"                      alt=" "                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Within very less time application will get opened with a fresh window on your system.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="2024’S-Elite-Video-Capturing-Technology"><a href="#2024’S-Elite-Video-Capturing-Technology" class="headerlink" title="2024’S Elite Video Capturing Technology"></a>2024’S Elite Video Capturing Technology</h2><p>When you ask an expert or a professional about which is the best camera of 2024, you’ll probably will receive a different answer from both. Depending on what you want to use it for, the best camera for recording YouTube videos won’t be the same as a camera you would pick for live streaming on Twitch, a holiday or for starting as an influencer. In this article we’ve collected a wide range of camera models at different price points, including, action cameras, smartphones, DSLR’s, mirrorless cameras and purpose-made cameras. All of the included cameras film video in completely different ways and some models are better alternatives than others.</p><p>With that said, let’s dive right in!</p><h2 id="1-Fujifilm-X-S10"><a href="#1-Fujifilm-X-S10" class="headerlink" title="1. Fujifilm X-S10"></a>1. Fujifilm X-S10</h2><p>The Fujifilm’s X-S10 has a 26-megapixel interchangeable lens that shoots high-quality 4K video and has a deep grip and a different, though splendid, control scheme than other Fujifilm cameras. Fujifilm describes the X-S10 as a mix between the Fujifilm’s X-T30 and the X-H1 series. You get the strength from the previous model and the design and in-body photo stabilization. This X-S10 camera is suitable for both beginners and experienced users that use Nikon or Canon DSLR’s and want something a little more similar than a regular Fujifilm camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/fujifilm-x-s10.jpg"                      alt="fujifilm x s10"                ></p><p>Fujifilm did not disclose what the S is standing for in the name of the X-S10, we think it might stand for ‘small’ or ‘slim’, or maybe ‘simple’. Let’s take a look at the details: the X-S10 measures 126 x 85x 65 mm and weighs 465 grams. For the dimensions, it lays between the X-T30 and the X-T4.</p><p><strong>Fujifilm X-S10 specifications</strong></p><ul><li>Single UHS-I card slot</li><li>5-axis in-body image stabilization</li><li>Wi-Fi + Bluetooth</li><li>On-sensor phase detection</li><li>325 shots per charge using LCD</li><li>26MP X-Trans BSI-CMOS sensor</li><li>3”, 1.04M-dot fully articulating touchscreen</li><li>30 fps burst shooting with crop (up to 20 fps without)</li><li>USB Power Delivery support</li><li>36M-dot OLED electronic viewfinder</li><li>DCI and UHD 4K capture at up to 30p with F-Log support</li><li>External mic and headphone sockets</li></ul><h2 id="2-Canon-EOS-R5"><a href="#2-Canon-EOS-R5" class="headerlink" title="2. Canon EOS R5"></a>2. Canon EOS R5</h2><p>In our opinion, the Canon EOS R5 is by far Canon’s most precious product. It’s the perfect combination of the EOS R’s form, the EOS 5D’s function, together with the professional autofocus of the EOS-1D X. If you’re a hybrid or a stills shooter who shifts between videography and photography. It’s one of the most robust cameras you will ever own. It has achieved a lot of wrong attention, probably for overheating (or the possibility of it) when recording your videos in 8K resolution. But this should not decrease the quality of this camera’s incredible potential.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/canon-eos-r5.jpg"                      alt="canon eos r5"                ></p><p>With its frame rate and its video capabilities combined together, this is honestly a monumental camera. It’s taken the spot of the more expensive Sony A1 just to see how good this EOS R5 from Canon is. The Canon EOS R5 is incredible at photographing wildlife, it’s more or less a way around for capturing images of animals and people, or other objects from far away or close-up shots.</p><p>For the professional photographer who needs speed, video capabilities and resolution, there is the Canon EOS R5. Setting a new boundary for versatility, the full-frame mirrorless camera contains a perfectly designed 45-megapixel CMOS sensor, which offers 12 fps continuous shooting with a mechanical shutter, 8K raw video recording. It’s the first EOS camera to contain a 5-axis sensor-shift image stabilizer.</p><p><strong>Canon EOS R5 specifications</strong></p><ul><li>ISO range: 100-51,200 (expandable to 50-102,400)</li><li>Image processor: Digic X</li><li>AF points: 5,940 Dual Pixel CMOS AF II</li><li>Sensor: 45MP full-frame CMOS 36 x 24mm</li><li>Max image size: 8,192 x 5,464px</li><li>Video: 8K DCI or UHD at 30p, 24p &#x2F; 4K DCI or UHD at 120p, 100p, 60p, 50p, 30p, 25p, 24p &#x2F; 1080p (FullHD) at 60p, 50p, 30p, 25p, 24p</li><li>Max burst: 12fps mechanical shutter, 20fps electronic shutter</li><li>Viewfinder: 0.5-inch OLED EVF, 5,690k dots, 100% coverage, 0.76x magnification, 120fps refresh rate</li><li>Memory card: 1x CFexpress type B, 1x UHS-II SD&#x2F;SDHC&#x2F;SDXC</li><li>Stabilization: 5-axis, up to 8 stops</li><li>Metering zones: 384</li><li>LCD: 3.15-inch fully articulating touchscreen, 2,100k dots.</li><li>Connectivity: Wi-Fi 5Ghz and 2.4GHz, Bluetooth 4.2, USB-C (USB 3.1 Gen 2), micro HDMI (type D), microphone, headphone, N3 remote, flash sync, gigabit ethernet (via WFT-R10 grip)</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135416/19272" target="_top" id="2135416">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135416" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="336" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135416/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Nikon-D3500"><a href="#3-Nikon-D3500" class="headerlink" title="3. Nikon D3500"></a>3. Nikon D3500</h2><p>The Nikon D3500 is one of the best DSLR cameras available for beginners that are looking to create stunning, manual photos using a regular setup. While it’s containing great image quality, easy-to-use menus and a superior battery life, this camera offers incredible value. Mirrorless competition should also be contemplated, especially when you want 4K resolution or a touch screen for easier use. After our review, this Nikon’s entry-level DSLR keeps the lead by giving the type of value and quality that mirrorless cameras do not succeed to accomplish.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/nikon-d3500.jpg"                      alt="nikon d3500"                ></p><p>When you are searching for a smaller camera for recording traveling content, other mirrorless options like the Canon EOS M50 Mark II or Fujifilm X-T200 are great possibilities too. When it comes to an affordable camera for starters, the Nikon D3500 is the perfect solution. The D3500’s ISO sensitivity range of 100-25,600 is quite wide and doesn’t improve on the D3400’s range.</p><p>Nikon decided to keep the same 3-inch display, including the 921,000-dot resolution from the D3400 model. If you desire a DSLR with a vari-angle display, then you should explore the range to the Nikon D5600.</p><p>Seeing the rear screen is an optical viewfinder. This is perhaps the clearest feature that distinguishes DSLR’s from mirrorless cameras. Many mirrorless cameras barely show on the rear screen for shooting, while other models will include viewfinders with quite better resolutions.</p><p><strong>Nikon D3500 Specifications:</strong></p><ul><li>Camera type: DSLR</li><li>Sensor: 24.2MP APS-C CMOS 4, 23.5 x 15.6mm</li><li>Lens mount: Nikon F</li><li>In-body image stabilization (IBIS): No</li><li>Full frame: No</li><li>AF points: 11-point AF, 1 cross-type</li><li>Image processor: EXPEED 4</li><li>Memory card: SD&#x2F;SDHC&#x2F;SDXC UHS I</li><li>Max image size: 6,000 x 4,000px</li><li>ISO range: 100 to 25,600</li><li>Video: 1920 x 1080 at 60p, 50p, 30p, 25p, 24p</li><li>Metering zones: 420 pixel RGB sensor</li><li>Viewfinder: Optical pentamirror, 95% coverage</li><li>Max burst: 5fps</li><li>LCD: 3.0-inch fixed, 921K dots</li><li>Size: 124 x 97 x 69.5mm (body only)</li><li>Connectivity: Bluetooth</li><li>Weight: 415g (body only, with battery and memory card)</li></ul><h2 id="4-Olympus-OM-D-E-M10-Mark-IV"><a href="#4-Olympus-OM-D-E-M10-Mark-IV" class="headerlink" title="4. Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark IV"></a>4. Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark IV</h2><p>Introducing the Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark IV! This is the entry-level camera in Olympus’s DSLR range of Micro Four Thirds models. This is definitely an upgrade from the beginner-range E-PL range, giving you more control, also improved quality and a wide range of features. This camera contains a 20-megapixel Four Thirds sensor, flip-down touchscreen, an in-body image stabilizer, an easy-to-use interface and of course the 4K video option. The E-M10 IV is out now in two types of kits, a black or silver body including the compact 14-42mm F3.5-5.6 EZ lens.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/olympus-omd-em10.jpg"                      alt="olympus omd em10"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123508/26400" target="_top" id="2123508">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123508" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123508/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The camera’s continuous autofocus has been redesigned using techniques from the E-M1X model. This reduces occurrences of the camera locking focus to the background and not focusing on your predetermined topic.</p><p>Olympus did also add a Live View Boost option that allows you to make both focusing and framing in darker environments a lot easier. The E-M10 III’s Live View Boost option hardly increases the viewfinder drive, but on the E-M10 IV it can also diminish the frame rate. This allows a substantially more luminant viewfinder frame.</p><p>The E-M10 IV is still employing a contrast-detect autofocus structure, For us it’s not a problem, even while shooting in 4K resolution. We noticed that the night display mode is way easier to use but implements only to the Remote Shutter screen. Its more red scheme supports in protecting your night vision while filming night skies, it does allows your external light source to be quickly changed with a vertical wipe onto the screen</p><p><strong>Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark IV specifications:</strong></p><ul><li>5-axis in-body image stabilization (up to 4.5 stops)</li><li>20 Megapixel Live MOS sensor (Four Thirds)</li><li>121-point contrast-detect AF system</li><li>Wi-Fi + Bluetooth</li><li>Flip-down touchscreen display</li><li>TruePic VIII processor</li><li>USB charging</li><li>Electronic viewfinder</li><li>360 shots per charge (with LCD)</li><li>5 fps burst shooting w&#x2F;AF</li></ul><h2 id="5-DJI-Pocket-2"><a href="#5-DJI-Pocket-2" class="headerlink" title="5. DJI Pocket 2"></a>5. DJI Pocket 2</h2><p>The DJI Pocket 2 is a second-generation all-in-one camera that has an amazing built-in three-axis stabilizer. This camera stays about the same capacity as the regular, and contains a wider lens, bigger sensor, more microphones, an improved autofocus system, with the option to film higher-quality videos photos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dji-pocket-2.jpg"                      alt="dji pocket 2"                ></p><p>The design of the Pocket 2 is almost the same to the original and it holds a Mini Control Stick that shove into the area previously kept free for a smartphone placement. When you are using the Mini Control Stick, the buttons to operate the Pocket will increase to five from two. We want to mention that there are a few changes with the button design, the operation is still natural just like the original.</p><p>The DJI Pocket comes standard with all accessories to use with your smartphone without the Do-It-All handle.</p><p>You need to tilt and zoom using the smartphone app, and that is not as spontaneous as the Mini Control Stick. The Do-It-All handle is perfect for using your smartphone like the screen. It’s crucial to download the Mimo application and the Do-It-All handle if you want to go stream.</p><p>The microphone quality on the Pocket is something to go for because of the extra microphones. It makes it super easy for recordings to sound way better than regular smartphones. The Pocket 2 has the option to shoot 3x3 panoramas. The 180º panorama captures four pictures and combines them into one long photo, while the 3x3 panorama mode captures 9 images and then puts them into a 5x7 image. We recommend a tripod with 3x3 panoramas to cancel out any camera shakes.</p><p><strong>DJI Pocket 2 Specifications:</strong></p><ul><li>DJI Pocket 2 specifications:</li><li>20mm (equiv.)

GoPro Hero 10 Black"></a>6. GoPro Hero 10 Black</h2><p>When we think about action cameras designed for sports, GoPro is the first thing that comes to mind. According to our records, the GoPro Hero 10 Black is GoPro’s new leader for 2024. It resembles a similar layout and the same sensor introduced on the GoPro Hero 9 Black edition. This camera is packed with a new processor. While the screens on the GoPro’s are LCD’s, they are not as crisp as AMOLED panels. The GoPro Hero 10 Black’s interface is the same as what previous GoPro’s. Wipe your finger to browse through the menus to go back and forth between the modes. Swipe up to show the video files on the memory card and swipe down to enter the camera settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/gopro-hero-10-black.jpg"                      alt="gopro hero 10 black"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037358/7443" target="_top" id="2037358">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037358" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037358/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>We can all agree that the GoPro Hero 9 Black is a solid camera, but its (sometimes) unresponsive LCD screen kind of broke people’s expectations. GoPro handles feedback really well and the camera also boasts quicker frame rates. The entire GoPro experience also saw a punch up in terms of experiences. The GoPro app now reinforces wired transfers and better live streaming support. This GoPro Hero 10 Black also showcases a new HyperSmooth 4.0 stabilization, which keeps video steadier.</p><p>We like to point out that it is a good idea to consider that there is no headphone jack, microphone input and video output, because there will already be a built-in microphone and speaker on the GoPro Hero 10.</p><p><strong>GoPro Hero 10 Black Specifications:</strong></p><ul><li>GoPro Hero 10 Black specifications:</li><li>Higher video framerates</li><li>Top-of-the-line digital stabilization</li><li>WiFi and Bluetooth Supported</li><li>More effiecient wire transfer</li><li>Digital Image Stabilization</li><li>1720 mAh rechargeable battery capacity via USB type-C</li><li>The new lens cover can repel water</li><li>No tripod mount and accessory shoe</li><li>Better and improved user interface</li><li>Waterproof of upto 10m</li><li>Doubled processor power</li><li>Interval Recording</li><li>No built-in light&#x2F;flash</li><li>Creative Effects</li><li>Burst Mode</li></ul><h2 id="7-Nikon-Z6-II"><a href="#7-Nikon-Z6-II" class="headerlink" title="7. Nikon Z6 II"></a>7. Nikon Z6 II</h2><p>The Nikon Z6 II is equipped with a whopping 24-megapixel sensor, it lays perfectly between processing power and resolution, a lot of people like the option to the professional grade Nikon Z7 II which comes with about the double megapixel count. There are not many differences between this camera and its forerunner. A difference is “II” nomenclature after the Z6 mark. We figured that it’s just a couple of millimeters deeper. We know that the Z6 II is the cheaper model of the two, one is more-affordable and better designed compared to the more-expensive brother, the Z7 II. Nikon chose to keep both the Z6 and the Z7 in its range so there’s would not be a reason why the upgrades available wouldn’t fit you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/nikon-z6-ii.jpg"                      alt="nikon z6 ii"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151893/7443" target="_top" id="2151893">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151893" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151893/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>We noticed that most of the Z6 II’s buttons are paired together to the right of the camera, so you can make changes with your fingers. The set of dials on the front and side of the grip feel natural to control aperture and its shutter speed. You see buttons for settings such as video recording, exposure compensation and ISO on the side. Even though there are no disappointments when talking about image quality. The Z6 II expresses the same sensor as its forerunner.</p><p>Personalize the controls on the Z6 II, on an attached lens and also on the body. You can navigate to the menu and configure these settings from there. In this camera model you also find the possibility to adjust how the focus ring acts on Z lenses (besides the Noct lens, which is not focus-by-wire). Because of the powered processing options comes a higher burst rate. We noticed an improved autofocus with support for Eye-AF in Wide Area AF modes.</p><p>To sum things up besides the specifications of this camera, we find this one of the most amazing full-frame mirrorless cameras available today. It has the lens mount and quality just right, despite the fact that is has much competition and considered not being a huge upgrade than the original model, the Z6 II is incredible in many way.</p><ul><li>Nikon Z6 II specifications:</li><li>Full-sensor UHD 4K video at up to 30p</li><li>24MP full-frame BSI-CMOS sensor</li><li>UHD 60p from an APS-C crop promised in future firmware update</li><li>Continuous shooting at up to 14 fps (in 12-bit Raw with single AF point)</li><li>69M-dot EVF with improved blackout times</li><li>Two card slots (1x CFexpress&#x2F;XQD, 1x UHS-II SD)</li><li>USB-C socket for recharging or powering the camera</li><li>Tilting 2.1M-dot read touchscreen</li><li>Connectors to allow battery grip with portrait orientation controls</li><li>Battery rating of 410 (LCD) and 340 (EVF) shots per charge</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-minimalist-obs-adjustments-for-under-500-pcs/"><u>[New] Minimalist OBS Adjustments for Under-$500 PCs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-mac-screenshots-transforming-extensions/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Mac Screenshots Transforming Extensions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/updated-complete-google-photos-guide-for-beginners/"><u>[Updated] Complete Google Photos Guide for Beginners</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-streamline-your-videos-10-best-flv-to-youtube-convertors-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Streamline Your Videos 10 Best FLV to YouTube Convertors for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/10-tips-and-tricks-to-better-use-pixlr-editor/"><u>10 Tips and Tricks to Better Use Pixlr Editor</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-captivating-costless-visual-collaboration-games/"><u>2024 Approved Captivating Costless Visual Collaboration Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/2024-approved-comparative-review-of-premium-streaming-services/"><u>2024 Approved Comparative Review of Premium Streaming Services</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/expert-tips-to-soften-sound-tracks-in-logic-pro/"><u>Expert Tips to Soften Sound Tracks in Logic Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-2-ways-to-transfer-text-messages-from-oppo-reno-9a-to-iphone-1514131211x8-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, 2 Ways to Transfer Text Messages from Oppo Reno 9A to iPhone 15/14/13/12/11/X/8/ | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-essence-extractor-capturing-and-saving-the-soul-of-twitter-gifs/"><u>In 2024, Essence Extractor Capturing & Saving the Soul of Twitter GIFs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/new-the-best-free-divx-video-cutting-software-for-2024/"><u>New The Best Free Divx Video Cutting Software for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/overcoming-iphone-lens-focus-discrepancies/"><u>Overcoming iPhone Lens Focus Discrepancies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/s-leading-lego-stop-motion-studios-and-filmmakers-for-2024/"><u>S Leading Lego Stop Motion Studios and Filmmakers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-dash.techidaily.com/speedy-and-straightforward-way-to-enhance-acer-audio-performance-by-updating-drivers/"><u>Speedy and Straightforward Way to Enhance Acer Audio Performance by Updating Drivers</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Beginner’s-Guide-to-Straightforward-HDR-Techniques"><a href="#The-Beginner’s-Guide-to-Straightforward-HDR-Techniques" class="headerlink" title="The Beginner’s Guide to Straightforward HDR Techniques"></a>The Beginner’s Guide to Straightforward HDR Techniques</h2><p>Any professional photographer knows that “photography” is a broad niche. For example, HDR photography involves taking images in dark and bright areas. But because these images might not show much to the naked eyes, you’ll need an HDR program like <strong>EasyHDR</strong>. This software can recreate and design incredible HDR photos on Mac and Windows computers. So, this review post advises you whether <strong>Easy HDR</strong> is worth the money or not. We’ll also advise on the best way to edit and create HDR videos on PC.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Summary-Box-on-Easy-HDR"><a href="#Part-1-Summary-Box-on-Easy-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Summary Box on Easy HDR"></a>Part 1: Summary Box on Easy HDR</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Description</th><th>EasyHDR is an HDR photography software for highlighting image details in HDR photos. It supports raw images and batch processing.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Pricing</td><td>$33 for a lifetime license</td></tr><tr><td>Operating System</td><td>Windows 7&#x2F;8&#x2F;10&#x2F;11 and macOS 10.12 or newer</td></tr><tr><td>Layout</td><td>4.5&#x2F;5</td></tr><tr><td>Easy to use</td><td>4.8&#x2F;5</td></tr><tr><td>HDQ quality</td><td>4.2&#x2F;5</td></tr><tr><td>Post-processing</td><td>3.5&#x2F;5</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Before we dive deeper into this <strong>Easy HDRi</strong> review, let’s first discuss how this HDR software rates in some critical aspects:</p><ol><li><strong>Effectiveness – 4.8&#x2F;5</strong></li></ol><p>The HDRi process on this software is very effective, although you shouldn’t have high expectations. It provides manual and automatic lens correction properties, although using the manual option might need a learning curve. Other extras include ghost removal and automatic alignment.</p><ol><li><strong>Price – 4.7&#x2F;5</strong></li></ol><p>Easy HDR is not necessarily a free program. Although there’s a free demo version, it’s pretty limited in features. Therefore, purchase the premium plan for $33 or $55 for personal and lifetime licenses. As a seasoned HDR editor, you should know that other HDR programs like Aurora HDR cost way more than this.</p><ol><li><strong>Supported OS – 5&#x2F;5</strong></li></ol><p>This HDR photography program is compatible with Windows and macOS systems, which is a big plus. You can install it on Windows 7 or newer and macOS 10.12 or newer. Sorry, Linux users!</p><ol><li><strong>Ease of use – 4.8</strong></li></ol><p>Easy HDR is one of the most beginner-friendly HDR processing tools despite the advanced management tools. It features automatic lens correction, ghost removal, and HDR merging capabilities.</p><ol><li><strong>Best for – Beginner HDRi editors</strong></li></ol><p>This program’s simple approach makes it perfect for HDRi photographers without prior editing skills. Also, if you’re a beginner on a tight budget, easyHDR is the best software for you.</p><p><strong>Our Verdict</strong></p><p>Up to this juncture, you might wonder if Easy HDR is worth the money or not. Well, that depends on what you want. If you have minimal HDR editing knowledge, then this is the best professional program for you.</p><p>The straightforward layout boasts automatic HDR editing tools to make your work effortless. In addition, it supports a wide array of image formats, including photos taken using your DSLR camera. And the $33&#x2F;lifetime price should be manageable by many average Joes.</p><p>But on the flip side, Easy HDR lacks in-depth post-processing tools. Also, it lacks the all-important “undo” feature, which is vital in HDR image editing. Other than that, it’s the perfect program to make dramatic and realistic HDR photos.</p><p>Pros</p><ul><li>Simple layout.</li><li>Make realistic HDR images with automatic tools.</li><li>Easy HDRi Blender and Adobe Lightroom plugins.</li><li>Standalone Easy HDR desktop program.</li><li>Batch processing supported.</li><li>Compatible with multiple image formats, including RAW.</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul><li>It doesn’t have advanced HDR post-processing tools.</li><li>No HDR feature for editing.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Detailed-Review-for-Easy-HDR"><a href="#Part-2-Detailed-Review-for-Easy-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Detailed Review for Easy HDR"></a>Part 2. Detailed Review for Easy HDR</h2><p>Before diving deeper into the detailed Easy HDR features, it’s important to note that the program has a demo version. You can use this version to practice and study the vital components of easyHDR. But be guided that the demo version exports images with a watermark. In addition, users can’t save HDRi in TIFF format. Let’s get in!</p><ol><li><strong>High-Quality Bracket Merging</strong></li></ol><p>A good quality HDRi software should easily merge different image exposures, making the photo look natural and spectacular. To start incorporating, drag the image brackets to easyHDR and press “Ok” on the pop-up screen. You can now try the different bracket merging effects until you find something that suits your preference.</p><ol><li><strong>Editing features</strong></li></ol><p>EasyHDR goes a step further to provide its users with a comprehensive list of editing features. For example, the “Clone Stamp” tool can remove unwanted objects like cables without blurring the photo. You can also use the “Tone Curve” feature to adjust the brightness of shadows and highlights.</p><ol><li><strong>Ghost removal</strong></li></ol><p>No, this is not the scary ghost that you know. Instead, these ghosting artefacts appear in misaligned photos due to moving objects like leaves, branches, cars, people, etc. With Easy HDR, you can eliminate the “ghosts” manually or automatically. Simply open the photo and turn on “Ghost Removal” to remove them automatically.</p><ol><li><strong>HDR batch processing</strong></li></ol><p>As expected, you can find it pretty tedious to import and merge each HDR bracket individually. For this reason, easyHDR comes with a “Batch Processing” feature that allows users to combine a whole folder of brackets automatically.</p><ol><li><strong>LDR enhancement</strong></li></ol><p>Although we’ve mainly focused on brackets and photos in this post, it’s important to note that easyHDR also works with single images. Instead of having three separate bracketed exposures, LDR (Low Dynamic Range) enhancement allows you to generate exposures from a single JPEG or RAW photo.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tips-The-Best-Way-to-Edit-HDR-videos-on-your-Desktop"><a href="#Bonus-Tips-The-Best-Way-to-Edit-HDR-videos-on-your-Desktop" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tips: The Best Way to Edit HDR videos on your Desktop"></a>Bonus Tips: The Best Way to Edit HDR videos on your Desktop</h2><p>Like HDR images, HDR videos offer more comprehensive displays in dark and bright surroundings. In short, these videos allow more colourful and detailed highlight representations. Unfortunately, not all HDR editing programs can merge bracketed exposures effortlessly to produce outstanding results. And those that do can cost you an arm and a leg.</p><p>With that in mind, we recommend <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for professional and semi-professional HDR editors. It’s a simple but detailed program that allows users to edit HDR materials quickly and easily. It houses thousands of free effects you’ll use with the Blending Mode to create nice HDR footage. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> works with any video format, including RAW footage from your camcorder. And of course, there are many other editing features like color correction, color grading, image stabilization, chroma key&#x2F;green screen, etc.</p><p><strong>Steps to add an HDR effect to a standard video on Filmora 11:</strong></p><h5 id="Step1Open-the-video-on-Filmora-11"><a href="#Step1Open-the-video-on-Filmora-11" class="headerlink" title="Step1Open the video on Filmora 11"></a>Step1Open the video on Filmora 11</h5><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/easy-hdr-1.jpg"                      alt="easy hdr alternative load video"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137205/26400" target="_top" id="2137205">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137205" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137205/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Run <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your Mac&#x2F;Win computer and start a new project.

Although it doesn’t feature much, the available editing features should be enough to help you create incredible HDR images. And don’t forget to use Wondershare Filmora 11 to apply a cool HDR effect to your footage. Give it a try!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p></articleBefore we dive deeper into this **Easy HDRi** review, let's first discuss how this HDR software rates in some critical aspects:<ol><li><strong>Effectiveness – 4.8&#x2F;5</strong></li></ol><p>The HDRi process on this software is very effective, although you shouldn’t have high expectations. It provides manual and automatic lens correction properties, although using the manual option might need a learning curve. Other extras include ghost removal and automatic alignment.</p><ol><li><strong>Price – 4.7&#x2F;5</strong></li></ol><p>Easy HDR is not necessarily a free program. Although there’s a free demo version, it’s pretty limited in features. Therefore, purchase the premium plan for $33 or $55 for personal and lifetime licenses. As a seasoned HDR editor, you should know that other HDR programs like Aurora HDR cost way more than this.</p><ol><li><strong>Supported OS – 5&#x2F;5</strong></li></ol><p>This HDR photography program is compatible with Windows and macOS systems, which is a big plus. You can install it on Windows 7 or newer and macOS 10.12 or newer. Sorry, Linux users!</p><ol><li><strong>Ease of use – 4.8</strong></li></ol><p>Easy HDR is one of the most beginner-friendly HDR processing tools despite the advanced management tools. It features automatic lens correction, ghost removal, and HDR merging capabilities.</p><ol><li><strong>Best for – Beginner HDRi editors</strong></li></ol><p>This program’s simple approach makes it perfect for HDRi photographers without prior editing skills. Also, if you’re a beginner on a tight budget, easyHDR is the best software for you.</p><p><strong>Our Verdict</strong></p><p>Up to this juncture, you might wonder if Easy HDR is worth the money or not. Well, that depends on what you want. If you have minimal HDR editing knowledge, then this is the best professional program for you.</p><p>The straightforward layout boasts automatic HDR editing tools to make your work effortless. In addition, it supports a wide array of image formats, including photos taken using your DSLR camera. And the $33&#x2F;lifetime price should be manageable by many average Joes.</p><p>But on the flip side, Easy HDR lacks in-depth post-processing tools. Also, it lacks the all-important “undo” feature, which is vital in HDR image editing. Other than that, it’s the perfect program to make dramatic and realistic HDR photos.</p><p>Pros</p><ul><li>Simple layout.</li><li>Make realistic HDR images with automatic tools.</li><li>Easy HDRi Blender and Adobe Lightroom plugins.</li><li>Standalone Easy HDR desktop program.</li><li>Batch processing supported.</li><li>Compatible with multiple image formats, including RAW.</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul><li>It doesn’t have advanced HDR post-processing tools.</li><li>No HDR feature for editing.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Detailed-Review-for-Easy-HDR-1"><a href="#Part-2-Detailed-Review-for-Easy-HDR-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Detailed Review for Easy HDR"></a>Part 2. Detailed Review for Easy HDR</h2><p>Before diving deeper into the detailed Easy HDR features, it’s important to note that the program has a demo version. You can use this version to practice and study the vital components of easyHDR. But be guided that the demo version exports images with a watermark. In addition, users can’t save HDRi in TIFF format. Let’s get in!</p><ol><li><strong>High-Quality Bracket Merging</strong></li></ol><p>A good quality HDRi software should easily merge different image exposures, making the photo look natural and spectacular. To start incorporating, drag the image brackets to easyHDR and press “Ok” on the pop-up screen. You can now try the different bracket merging effects until you find something that suits your preference.</p><ol><li><strong>Editing features</strong></li></ol><p>EasyHDR goes a step further to provide its users with a comprehensive list of editing features. For example, the “Clone Stamp” tool can remove unwanted objects like cables without blurring the photo. You can also use the “Tone Curve” feature to adjust the brightness of shadows and highlights.</p><ol><li><strong>Ghost removal</strong></li></ol><p>No, this is not the scary ghost that you know. Instead, these ghosting artefacts appear in misaligned photos due to moving objects like leaves, branches, cars, people, etc. With Easy HDR, you can eliminate the “ghosts” manually or automatically. Simply open the photo and turn on “Ghost Removal” to remove them automatically.</p><ol><li><strong>HDR batch processing</strong></li></ol><p>As expected, you can find it pretty tedious to import and merge each HDR bracket individually. For this reason, easyHDR comes with a “Batch Processing” feature that allows users to combine a whole folder of brackets automatically.</p><ol><li><strong>LDR enhancement</strong></li></ol><p>Although we’ve mainly focused on brackets and photos in this post, it’s important to note that easyHDR also works with single images. Instead of having three separate bracketed exposures, LDR (Low Dynamic Range) enhancement allows you to generate exposures from a single JPEG or RAW photo.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tips-The-Best-Way-to-Edit-HDR-videos-on-your-Desktop-1"><a href="#Bonus-Tips-The-Best-Way-to-Edit-HDR-videos-on-your-Desktop-1" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tips: The Best Way to Edit HDR videos on your Desktop"></a>Bonus Tips: The Best Way to Edit HDR videos on your Desktop</h2><p>Like HDR images, HDR videos offer more comprehensive displays in dark and bright surroundings. In short, these videos allow more colourful and detailed highlight representations. Unfortunately, not all HDR editing programs can merge bracketed exposures effortlessly to produce outstanding results. And those that do can cost you an arm and a leg.</p><p>With that in mind, we recommend <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for professional and semi-professional HDR editors. It’s a simple but detailed program that allows users to edit HDR materials quickly and easily.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Building-Brand-Authority-Top-Tips-for-Novice-Marketers-on-Reddit"><a href="#Building-Brand-Authority-Top-Tips-for-Novice-Marketers-on-Reddit" class="headerlink" title="Building Brand Authority: Top Tips for Novice Marketers on Reddit"></a>Building Brand Authority: Top Tips for Novice Marketers on Reddit</h2><p>The past few years have taught business owners a valuable lesson. It has never been easier to start an online business and succeed.</p><p>There are plenty of ways to do this. But Reddit marketing is proving to be among the most promising ones. Reddit is a platform where communities of over 1.5 billion users in total gather every month.</p><p>Using the right Reddit marketing strategy can result in more sales, clients, and traffic. This guide will be your crash course on how to do Reddit marketing. Expect tons of actionable tips that will help you succeed faster.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-Does-Reddit-Work"><a href="#Part-1-How-Does-Reddit-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How Does Reddit Work?"></a>Part 1. How Does Reddit Work?</h2><p>Reddit is a place for gathering. It’s where communities of all interests can connect and share ideas, knowledge, experiences, and more.</p><p>The rules of Reddit are simple.</p><p><strong>Upvotes &amp; Downvotes</strong></p><p>First, there are Upvotes and Downvotes. This determines which posts go on top and which ones get buried down below. The more Upvotes a post has, the more it will be seen. The more Downvotes it has, the more irrelevant it becomes.</p><p><strong>SubReddits</strong></p><p>Subreddits are communities within Reddit. Each subreddit is dedicated to a topic. For example, there are subreddits about food, gaming, and finance…… you name it!</p><p>Each subreddit has its members. Some have hundreds of thousands of members, while other subreddits only have a couple of hundred or fewer.</p><p>The idea behind them is to make Reddit a more organized place where you can easily find what you’re looking for.</p><p><strong>Content and Posting</strong></p><p>The most important part of Reddit is the posts. What you post can have a significant impact on whether you reach a vast audience or not.</p><p>Ideally, posting valuable advice that will genuinely help someone out works best. However, you can also post entertaining content, personal experiences, and more.</p><p>You’ll be fine if it doesn’t go against Reddit’s guidelines.</p><p><strong>Reddit Karma</strong></p><p>Last but not least, Reddit Karma is another crucial feature. It is a status symbol. It reflects how much you contribute to each Reddit community. The more Karma you have, the more authority and value your actions on Reddit have.</p><p>You can earn more Reddit karma by receiving Upvotes on your posts and comments.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136625/26400" target="_top" id="2136625">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136625" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136625/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Should-You-Do-Reddit-Marketing"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Should-You-Do-Reddit-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Let’s look at some facts.</p><ul><li>Reddit currently gets <strong>1.7 billion</strong>monthly users</li><li>It is ranked <strong>#19</strong>out of all the other sites on the internet globally</li><li>It is also ranked <strong>#12</strong>among all the websites in the United States</li></ul><p>All this means is that you have billions of potential customers to reach on Reddit each month. As a result, it may be the perfect platform for you to market your business and achieve amazing results.</p><p>There are even more good news and reasons to attempt a Reddit marketing strategy for your business.</p><p>Reddit has a somewhat unique audience. Close to <strong>50%</strong> of Reddit users don’t use Instagram. A higher percentage than this don’t use TikTok as well. Additionally, <strong>90%</strong> of Reddit users go there to learn about new products and brands.</p><p>That is an excellent opportunity to use Reddit marketing for your business. It’s literally where people go to learn more about your business.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1972665/19272" target="_top" id="1972665">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1972665" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1972665/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Market-on-Reddit-5-Actionable-Ways"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Market-on-Reddit-5-Actionable-Ways" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

To get good results, your content MUST help the reader in some way. Find out what your audience’s problems are and pour your heart and soul into finding a solution for them.</p><p>It will be worth it in the long run.</p><p><strong>Be Consistent and Persistent</strong></p><p>Doing one Reddit post, no matter how good it may be, will rarely do the trick. The key to creating any type of content is consistency and value.</p><p>There are three major reasons why this is crucial:</p><p>- It builds trust among your audience. This makes it easier to sell to them later</p><p>- Adds a lot to your credibility. The more you increase your credibility, the easier it is to sell to new viewers</p><p>- It gets more eyes on you. The more content you post, the more potential customers you acquire</p><p><strong>Listen to Feedback and Host AMAs</strong></p><p>AMA stands for “Ask Me Anything”. This offers a perfect opportunity for you to connect with your audience. It lets you find out more about them. This is crucial information that will help you increase your sales and make more money in the long run.</p><p>Feedback is very important for a growing business. It’s a simple way to research your audience. Remember, the more you know about their fears, issues, attractions, and similar… the more you can improve your brand and meet their demands.</p><p>Reddit has its own<a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/" >AMA subreddit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It currently has over 22 million members. Here, you can post who you are and what you do. Then, expect plenty of questions from your audience.</p><p><strong>Always Support Your Audience</strong></p><p>Making money is great. But, always promoting your business and talking about yourself will never bring good results. The key is to put your audience in front.</p><p>You need to care about your customers. Talk to them, offer free advice, listen to their needs, and engage more with them. The more you put their interests ahead of your own, the better the impact on your business.</p><p>For example, when a user asked “<a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1fel08/what%5Fcompany%5Fhas%5Fsuch%5Fgood%5Fcustomer%5Fservice%5Fthat/" >What company has such good customer service that every other company should aspire to? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“, the comments were overflooded with the word “Amazon”.</p><p><strong>Advertise on Reddit</strong></p><p>There are two types of Reddit ads you need to be doing:</p><ul><li>Takeover Ads</li><li>Promoted Ads</li></ul><p>To be successful with your Reddit marketing strategy, you must know how to run ads.</p><p>The first step is to go over as many<a class="link"   href="https://www.reddiquette.com/reddit-ad-examples/" >examples of successful Reddit marketing campaigns <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as you can.</p><p>Second, you must familiarize yourself with<a class="link"   href="https://redditinc.force.com/helpcenter/s/article/Reddit-Advertising-Policy-Overview" >Reddit’s advertising policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Make sure you’re not creating an ad that goes against their rules.</p><p>Lastly, have a clear objective. Know why you’re creating your ad. Is it to increase your audience? Is it to get more sales? Is there another reason?</p><p>Knowing all of this will significantly improve your results and also give you insights on what type of Reddit ad to create. And now, you know how to market on Reddit. So, go out there and make this happen.</p><h2 id="Part-4-A-Bonus-Tip-The-Best-Video-Editor-for-Reddit"><a href="#Part-4-A-Bonus-Tip-The-Best-Video-Editor-for-Reddit" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

How To Use Magic Cut To Remove The Image’s Background"></a>2. How To Use Magic Cut To Remove The Image’s Background</h3><p>If your picture has a complicated background, the following steps will help you use the Magic Cut tool to <strong>remove the image’s background with Photopea:</strong></p><p>Step1 In the first step, import your image file to Photopea and right-click on its background.</p><p>Step2 Next, select the <strong>“Magic Cut”</strong> option in the menu.</p><p>Step3 In the next window, use the red brush to mark your background, the green one to select your subject, and the grey brush to remove the automatically generated selection.</p><p>You can modify the brush size using the drop-down icon at the top-right of the window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/using-magic-cut-to-remove-image-background-in-photopea.png"                      alt="using magic cut to remove image background in photopea"                ></p><p>Step4 Once satisfied with your changes, click <strong>“OK”</strong> to save your settings and remove the background.</p><h3 id="3-Select-the-Subject-Manually-When-The-Image-Is-Detailed"><a href="#3-Select-the-Subject-Manually-When-The-Image-Is-Detailed" class="headerlink" title="3. Select the Subject Manually When The Image Is Detailed"></a>3. Select the Subject Manually When The Image Is Detailed</h3><p>Although Magic Cut can handle difficult photos, there are also more precise tools available in Photopea that can help you erase the background from your images through manual selection. However, this process will be slower if your image is very detailed.</p><p>Manual selection tools vary with pictures to best suit your needs, which you can find under <strong>“Rectangle Select”</strong> and <strong>“Magic Wand”</strong> in the sidebar. Right-click on these tools to see the sub-tools available for each.</p><p>Step1 Visit the Photopea website and import your image.
