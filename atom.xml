This guide will tell you everything you need to know about how to configure the best computer for 4K editing, all by yourself. 4K videos are becoming popular, and give significantly more details when compared to the current standard of 1080p. Editing 4K videos require higher specifications than the standard computers used by an average person. Read along to know what exactly you need in a PC to do the job.</p><h4 id="1-CPU-the-Faster-the-Better"><a href="#1-CPU-the-Faster-the-Better" class="headerlink" title="1.  CPU- the Faster, the Better"></a>1.  CPU- the Faster, the Better</h4><p>The CPU, that is, the processor of your computer is the first thing you would want to look at while building a PC for any purpose on this Earth! It this unit which will load the OS (Operating System), run all the programs and make all the calculations. So, basically, how efficiently and quickly you can perform the editing mostly depends on the CPU. Its speed is largely determined by the clock speed, which is measure in GigaHertz (GhZ). If you have a limited budget, go for AMD Ryzen 5 CPU (estimated price: $250 - $280) which has 6 cores and 12 threads. The i9 7900X CPU ($1250 - $1300) with a whopping 10 cores and 20 threads is the fastest CPU out there for video editing.</p><p><strong>What to see in a CPU?</strong></p><ul><li>The clock speed- the higher, the better</li><li>Number of cores- The bigger, the better</li><li>Socket- Must be compatible with your motherboard</li><li>Cache, memory bandwidth and other factors.</li></ul><h4 id="2-The-GPU-or-the-Graphics-Card-Not-Essential-but-Highly-Recommended"><a href="#2-The-GPU-or-the-Graphics-Card-Not-Essential-but-Highly-Recommended" class="headerlink" title="2.  The GPU or the Graphics Card- Not Essential but Highly Recommended"></a>2.  The GPU or the Graphics Card- Not Essential but Highly Recommended</h4><p>If you have a very fast CPU, it is not absolutely necessary that you get a GPU for your 4K editing computer. However, having a good GPU will make a lot of difference. It relieves the CPU from performing graphic intensive tasks, and is specially designed to do that. Some software largely depend on the GPU or the graphics card for encoding and rendering, although a lot of other software will run quite smoothly if you have cheap graphics card or even if there isn’t any. For lower budgets, the GTX 1050 ($175 - $200) is recommended. If, however, you have a serious budget, go for an NVIDIA card from the 900 series (around $330). The highest performance cards are GTX 1080Ti $910-$980) and the Titan Xp ($1950). It is not recommended to spend too much on GPU unless you know you are dealing with highly graphics intensive job.</p><p><strong>Things to keep in mind:</strong></p><ul><li>Don’t spend too much.</li><li>Consider your CPU.</li><li>Consider your software.</li></ul><h4 id="3-The-Random-Access-Memory-RAM-The-More-the-Better"><a href="#3-The-Random-Access-Memory-RAM-The-More-the-Better" class="headerlink" title="3.  The Random Access Memory (RAM)- The More, the Better"></a>3.  The Random Access Memory (RAM)- The More, the Better</h4><p>Generally speaking, RAM is the memory available to the programs- it is where they are loaded. For 4K editing, you will need some 16 GB of Ram to keep it nice and smooth. It is very critical that you get sufficient memory for you editing software. Be comfortable while investing in RAM as video editing software use a lot of it.</p><p><strong>What is VRAM?</strong></p><p>Well, VRAM and RAM, although sound alike, are pretty different in functioning. A VRAM (Video RAM) basically works with the GPU by focusing on storing graphic data. The VRAM will see how many 3D and D images can be displayed simultaneously.</p><p><strong>How to choose the perfect RAM</strong></p><ul><li>Size: Minimum 8 GB for 4K editing, 4GB for 1080p</li><li>Kind of RAM (DDR2, DDR3, DDR4): Determines compatibility with motherboard</li><li>Other Factors: Speed (MHz), Timing (Latency), etc.</li></ul><h4 id="4-Storage"><a href="#4-Storage" class="headerlink" title="4.  Storage"></a>4.  Storage</h4><p>When it comes to storage, you have two broad options to choose from: HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) and SSDs (Solid State Drives). While HDDs use physical spinning discs to write and read data, there are memory chips in solid state drives that store data. SDDs are way faster than HDDs, but quite intuitively, more expensive. The ideal media storage is three to four times the expected size of a project’s source footage.</p><p>Key factors while determining storage for 4K editing software include:</p><ul><li>Spin speed: Should not be less than 7200 rpm for smooth 4K video editing</li><li>Type: SDDs are faster, (and expensive), not necessary but small SDD storage recommended for OS and important software</li></ul><h4 id="5-Motherboard"><a href="#5-Motherboard" class="headerlink" title="5.  Motherboard"></a>5.  Motherboard</h4><p>The motherboard is the central piece of your system that connects every component of the PC. The most important thing while selecting the motherboard for any PC remains the compatibility check. Your CPU must (absolutely must) be compatible with the motherboard. Do make sure the motherboard uses same socket as the CPU for your computer to work. For instance, the latest intel i-series chips, the i3, i5 and i7 have the LGA 1151 socket, so you want a motherboard compatible with LGA 1151.</p><p><strong>Things to see in a motherboard</strong></p><ul><li>Socket</li><li>High quality integrated sound (You don’t want to deal with the complexity of sound cards)</li><li>Number of 3.0 USB ports</li><li>Number of SATA connections supported (for storage)</li></ul><h4 id="6-Display-Monitor"><a href="#6-Display-Monitor" class="headerlink" title="6.  Display (Monitor)"></a>6.  Display (Monitor)</h4><p>Again, 4K monitors aren’t necessary, but always a plus. They allow you to visualise more clearly the changes and the effects, once you are done editing and provide a lot of space to work on. And, with 4K becoming the new standard, it would be great if you have 4K TV!</p><h4 id="7-Video-editing-software"><a href="#7-Video-editing-software" class="headerlink" title="7.  Video editing software"></a>7.  Video editing software</h4><p>So, which video editing software to use?</p><p>There is a host of software available for video editing. But, not all of them will support 4K video editing. Here is a list of top 4K editing software.</p><p>Note: This list does not indicate a ranking or order of preference.</p><p>1.<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>: it performs better on the various graphics processor, RAM, or Disk. Here are the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4k editing system requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>2.Adobe Premiere Pro CC</p><p>3.Sony Movie Studio 3 Platinum</p><p>4.Sony Vega Pro 13</p><p>5.Apple Final Cut Pro X2</p><p>6.Cyberlink Power Director 13 Ultra</p><p>7.Apple iMovie</p><p>Make sure you select the software that your computer will support, i.e., you have the minimum system requirements for the chosen software.</p><p>And that’s it! Now you can build the best computer for 4K video editing that will suit your requirements, fit in your budget, and most importantly, will be tailored for your job! While there are so many pre-built computers configured especially for 4K video editing, a lot of them will hurt your pocket a lot and will be loaded with too many features that you may never need. As they say, if you want to get something done well, do it yourself. And don’t forget, the first and most important element is you. Keep learning and keep editing! Happy editing to you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/immediate-access-free-download-of-hp-deskjet-2755e-drivers-optimized-for-windows-systems/"><u>[Immediate Access] Free Download of HP DeskJet 2755E Drivers: Optimized for Windows Systems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/new-craftsmanship-in-photos-and-videos-the-ultimate-8-mobile-enhancement-tools/"><u>[New] Craftsmanship in Photos & Videos The Ultimate 8 Mobile Enhancement Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-easy-ways-to-screen-record-instagram-story-for-2024/"><u>[New] Easy Ways to Screen Record Instagram Story for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-elevate-your-social-score-best-tools-for-post-and-engagement/"><u>[New] Elevate Your Social Score Best Tools for Post and Engagement</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-audiophiles-choice-premium-asmr-recording-mics/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Audiophiles' Choice Premium ASMR Recording Mics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/auditory-mastery-selecting-background-music-for-vids-for-2024/"><u>Auditory Mastery Selecting Background Music for Vids for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/full-solutions-to-fix-error-code-920-in-google-play-on-vivo-s17-pro-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Full Solutions to Fix Error Code 920 In Google Play on Vivo S17 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/in-2024-best-iphone-photo-marker-selection-unveiled/"><u>In 2024, Best iPhone Photo Marker Selection Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/24-live-speech-to-text-converter/"><u>In 2024, Live Speech to Text Converter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-what-does-enter-puk-code-mean-and-why-did-the-sim-get-puk-blocked-on-vivo-s18e-device-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, What Does Enter PUK Code Mean And Why Did The Sim Get PUK Blocked On Vivo S18e Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/mac-video-editing-made-easy-install-lumafusion-or-choose-an-alternative-for-2024/"><u>Mac Video Editing Made Easy Install Lumafusion or Choose an Alternative for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/navigating-the-best-lipo-cells-for-quality-flight-time/"><u>Navigating the Best LiPo Cells for Quality Flight Time</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/spectral-vision-next-gen-drone-review/"><u>Spectral Vision Next-Gen Drone Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/text-transformation-tricks-for-media/"><u>Text Transformation Tricks for Media</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/top-6-android-apps-for-immersive-music-videos/"><u>Top 6 Android Apps for Immersive Music Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/ultimate-tutorial-screen-skype-via-obs-for-2024/"><u>Ultimate Tutorial Screen Skype via OBS for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136619/26400" target="_top" id="2136619">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136619" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136619/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Innovative-Imagery-The-Art-of-Digital-Bending"><a href="#Innovative-Imagery-The-Art-of-Digital-Bending" class="headerlink" title="Innovative Imagery: The Art of Digital Bending"></a>Innovative Imagery: The Art of Digital Bending</h2><p>In this Photoshop tutorial, we’re going to carve an image using four simple steps. Curving an image can be a great way to add some extra visual interest and dimension, and it’s a technique that can be used with a wide range of images. So, let’s get started!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/curve-image-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="curve image photoshop"                ></p><h2 id="Simple-Steps-to-Curve-an-Image-in-Photoshop"><a href="#Simple-Steps-to-Curve-an-Image-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="Simple Steps to Curve an Image in Photoshop"></a>Simple Steps to Curve an Image in Photoshop</h2><h5 id="Step1Create-a-New-Document"><a href="#Step1Create-a-New-Document" class="headerlink" title="Step1Create a New Document"></a>Step1Create a New Document</h5><p>To keep things simple, let’s start with a white canvas. Let’s open a new document now by going to File in the menu bar and tapping New. Alternatively, you may press Ctrl+N or Command+N on your keyboard to generate a new document. Choose a size and orientation that is appropriate for your image.</p><h5 id="Step2Place-the-Image"><a href="#Step2Place-the-Image" class="headerlink" title="Step2Place the Image"></a>Step2Place the Image</h5><p>After creating the new document, open the image that you want to curve. You may do so by going to File &gt; Open in the menu bar or pressing Ctrl+O or Command+O on your keyboard. Once the image is open, go to Edit in the menu bar and select Place Embedded from the drop-down menu that appears. Select your image and click Place. The image will be placed on the canvas. If the document’s size does not match that of the image, you will see a transformation box surrounding the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/place-image-in-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="place image in photoshop"                ></p><h5 id="Step3Warp-the-Image"><a href="#Step3Warp-the-Image" class="headerlink" title="Step3Warp the Image"></a>Step3Warp the Image</h5><p>Now we’ll curve the image using the Warp Tool. Select the Warp Tool by clicking and holding on the Transform Tool in the toolbar. The Warp Tool is located at the bottom of the Transform Tool’s fly-out menu. Alternatively, you may press Ctrl+T or Command+T on your keyboard to open the Transform Tool’s fly-out menu and then select the Warp Tool from there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/wrap-image-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="wrap image photoshop"                ></p><p>With the Warp Tool selected, hover your cursor over the image. You’ll see a grid appear over the image. Click and drag one of the middle nodes in the horizontal direction to begin curving the image. As you drag, you’ll see the image curve along with your cursor. If you want to increase or decrease the amount of curvature, simply press and hold the Shift key while dragging the node.</p><p>Play around with the settings in the options bar. There are quite a few different looks you can achieve just by adjusting these.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/change-image-height-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="change image height photoshop"                ></p><p>20% <strong>Horizontal Distortion</strong> makes one side of the image appear larger than the other. This is what my photo looks like at 20%.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/change-horizontal-distortion-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="change horizontal distortion photoshop"                ></p><p><strong>Vertical Distortion</strong> makes the image look as if it’s leaning backward.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/verticle-distortion-image-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="verticle distortion image photoshop"                ></p><p>The <strong>Bend Direction</strong> option rotates the angle of the bend.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/bend-direction-image-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="bend direction image photoshop"                ></p><p>Flip any of these effects in the opposite direction by placing a negative sign in front of the percentage. Here’s -20% in the <strong>Bend</strong> box with a vertical bend.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/flip-effect-image-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="flip effect image photoshop"                ></p><h5 id="Step4Save-the-Image"><a href="#Step4Save-the-Image" class="headerlink" title="Step4Save the Image"></a>Step4Save the Image</h5><p>Once you’re happy with the way your image looks, go to File &gt; Save As in the menu bar or press Ctrl+Shift+S or Command+Shift+S on your keyboard. Choose a file format and location to save your image and click Save. And that’s it! You’ve successfully curved</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/save-curve-image-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="save curve image photoshop"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/1186802/12108" target="_top" id="1186802">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-1186802" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://dhgate.sjv.io/i/5597632/1186802/12108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We hope this post has helped you learn how to curve an image in Photoshop.

In fact, according to a recent study, 92% of consumers say they heavily rely on online reviews and testimonials when making purchasing decisions. 88% of those consumers say they trust those testimonials as much as personal recommendations from their friends, family members, and colleagues. This means that if you can get your clients or customers talking about how great your products or services are on camera, it will help them make buying decisions, reinforce your brand message and build relationships with their followers and peers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/video-testimonial.jpg"                      alt="video testimonial"                ></p><h2 id="Why-Video-Testimonials-Are-Important-for-Marketing"><a href="#Why-Video-Testimonials-Are-Important-for-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Why Video Testimonials Are Important for Marketing"></a>Why Video Testimonials Are Important for Marketing</h2><h3 id="Video-testimonials-help-customers-make-their-buying-decisions"><a href="#Video-testimonials-help-customers-make-their-buying-decisions" class="headerlink" title="Video testimonials help customers make their buying decisions"></a>Video testimonials help customers make their buying decisions</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/help-customers-decisions.jpg"                      alt="help customers decisions"                ></p><p>Video testimonials are an amazing way to demonstrate the value of your business. They help customers make their buying decisions, they’re more effective than written testimonials, and they are more authentic and believable than the written ones.</p><p>Video testimonials help reinforce your company’s message. When you see a product or service demonstrated in action by someone who is actually using it in real life—which is what happens when you watch a video—you can get a much better understanding of what it does for people who experience it firsthand. This can make an enormous difference when trying to convey the benefits of something like an electric toothbrush or headphones compared to just reading about them on paper or hearing about them from someone else who may not be fully knowledgeable about how awesome these products really are!</p><p>It also helps build relationships with potential clients because videos allow us to connect with people on a personal level in ways that would otherwise be impossible through text-only formats such as email messages only ever so briefly exchanged between two parties before being quickly forgotten forever when we move onto other things.</p><h3 id="Video-testimonials-help-reinforce-your-company’s-message"><a href="#Video-testimonials-help-reinforce-your-company’s-message" class="headerlink" title="Video testimonials help reinforce your company’s message"></a>Video testimonials help reinforce your company’s message</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/reinforce-company-message.jpg"                      alt="reinforce company message"                ></p><p>Video testimonials are a great way to reinforce your company’s message and make potential customers feel like they know you, your business, and your products.</p><p>When customers see another person saying good things about their service, it makes them more likely to trust and use that service themselves. Video testimonials can help you reach a larger audience by being shared on social media, review sites, and other marketing channels.</p><p>If you want to build trust with your audience, having real people talk about their experiences in using your products is a great way to do it. Video testimonials can help you get more customers by showing them that other people have had good experiences with your product and that it does what it says it does. They can also help you sell more because when someone sees someone else saying how much they love a product, they will think “hey, maybe I should try this too.”</p><h3 id="Video-testimonials-are-more-authentic-and-believable-than-written-ones"><a href="#Video-testimonials-are-more-authentic-and-believable-than-written-ones" class="headerlink" title="Video testimonials are more authentic and believable than written ones"></a>Video testimonials are more authentic and believable than written ones</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/authentic-video-testimonial.jpg"                      alt="authentic video testimonial"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137201/26400" target="_top" id="2137201">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137201" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137201/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Of course, written testimonials are still a great way to get your message across. However, video testimonials have some distinct advantages that make them more effective.</p><p>Consider this: Your prospective customer is going to be much more likely to click on the “read more” link in a written testimonial than they would be if you presented the same information in video form. That’s because videos are more memorable and emotional than text; they’re also more authentic and believable.</p><h3 id="Video-testimonials-help-build-relationships"><a href="#Video-testimonials-help-build-relationships" class="headerlink" title="Video testimonials help build relationships"></a>Video testimonials help build relationships</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/video-testimonial-build-relationships.jpg"                      alt="video testimonial build relationships"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137207/26400" target="_top" id="2137207">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137207" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137207/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>As you know, there are lots of ways to market your business.

Most of the headsets have the ability to track the user’s head movements so that the wherever the user looks, the character in the virtual reality also looks. If done in the right manner, the headsets give an impression of the user being actually inside the game or the movie, hence the name “virtual reality”.</p><h2 id="How-does-Virtual-Reality-headsets-work"><a href="#How-does-Virtual-Reality-headsets-work" class="headerlink" title="How does Virtual Reality headsets work"></a>How does Virtual Reality headsets work</h2><p> The principle goal of the virtual reality headsets is to create life-size, 3D virtual environments with no boundaries like those associated with computer or television screens. In case of the Rift or HTC’s Vive, video is sent from the computer or the console to the headset through a HDMI cable, while for the Google Cardboard or Samsung’s Gear VR, the videos are already on the smartphone mounted on the headsets.</p><p> The VR headsets may use a single feed or two feeds sent directly to either one or two LCD displays, one for each eye. There are also a set of lenses placed between the user’s eyes and the pixels and this is the reason why the devices are sometimes referred to as goggles. In some cases, the lenses can be adjusted to match the distance between the eyes and this distance will also vary from one user to another.</p><p> The lenses will focus and reshape the images for each eye before creating a stereoscopic 3D image by positioning the 2D images to portray how each of the two eyes see the world. One way in which the virtual reality headsets increases immersion is by increasing the field of view or simply how wide a picture appears. A 360 degrees display may not be convenient and most of the high end VR headsets usually use 100 or 110 degree field of views, which is usually sufficient enough to give the effects.</p><p> And for the final images to be totally convincing, the VR headsets use minimum frame rates of 60fps to do away with shuttering or make the users feel sick.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983551">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983551.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983551">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983551.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983551%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983551/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Top-VR-headsets-overview"><a href="#Top-VR-headsets-overview" class="headerlink" title="Top VR headsets overview"></a>Top VR headsets overview</h2><p> The race by tech giants to get their share of the virtual reality market is on and company after company is burning the midnight oil to produce the next best headset.</p><p> Below is a list of the various VR headsets currently available to purchase:</p><h3 id="HTC-Vive"><a href="#HTC-Vive" class="headerlink" title="HTC Vive"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.vive.com/" >HTC Vive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/htc-vive.png"                      alt="ghtc-vive-vr"                ></p><p> HTC Vive VR headset is made in collaboration with Valve and it plugs directly into PCs and uses Valve’s humongous gaming ecosystem.

With the Gear, all you have to do is to slot in the phone, put on the headset and start enjoying the virtual reality experience.</p><h3 id="Oculus-Rift"><a href="#Oculus-Rift" class="headerlink" title="Oculus Rift"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.oculus.com/rift/" >Oculus Rift <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/oculus-rift.jpg"                      alt="oculus-rift"                ></p><p> Oculus Rift headset was responsible for the current hysteria in virtual reality. The Rift plugs into the computer’s USB and DVI ports and tracks the movements of the head to provide 3D displays on its stereo screens. The consumer edition of the Rift comes with a 2160 x 1200 resolution as well as a refresh rate of 90Hz. The Rift matches HTC Vive in terms of the refresh rate, but lags behind Sony’s PlayStation VR, though it is a pretty advanced VR headset in terms of the technology used.</p><h3 id="Sony-PlayStation-VR"><a href="#Sony-PlayStation-VR" class="headerlink" title="Sony PlayStation VR"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/playstation-vr/" >Sony PlayStation VR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sony-playstation-vr.jpg"                      alt="sony-playstation-vr"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148637/16836" target="_top" id="2148637">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148637" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148637/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Sony has finally announced the launch date for the PlayStation VR headset and this is expected to be 13th October 2016. A new version though, was announced way back in 2015 and it featured a 5-inch LCD display of the original prototype. For the version to be released, it is expected to have a 5.7 inch OLED to allow for low persistence which will in turn translate to less motion blur. The refresh rate for Sony’s PlayStation VR has been ramped up to 120Hz, making it possible to have 120fps gaming.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/1172027/12108" target="_top" id="1172027">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-1172027" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://dhgate.sjv.io/i/5597632/1172027/12108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Google-Cardboard"><a href="#Google-Cardboard" class="headerlink" title="Google Cardboard"></a><a class="link"   href="https://vr.google.com/cardboard/" >Google Cardboard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-cardboard-vr.jpg"                      alt="google-cardboard-vr"                ></p><p> Not to be left behind, Google also has a cardboard virtual reality headset. With this headset, it sounds like popping your smartphone in a cardboard container and putting it over your head for a virtual reality experience. Sounds like a joke, but you will be pleasantly surprised to learn that it works like charm and it is also low cost. If anything, the smartphone you have already has all the gyroscopic sensors as well as the positioning devices needed to track your head movements.</p><p> Since the Cardboard has grown so much in terms of popularity, Google has planned to release a better version known as Daydream. This will be a device like the Gear VR, but it has been designed to work with android phones which are currently being revamped to over better VR experiences. It is still not know when the new device will be available, but the Cardboard is retailing at $16.99 at Amazon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/new-4kplus-3d-blu-ray-magic-high-end-players-guide/"><u>[New] 4K+ 3D Blu-Ray Magic High-End Players Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-highest-quality-mp4-adapter-for-fb-integration-for-2024/"><u>[New] Highest Quality MP4 Adapter for FB Integration for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-integrating-slack-and-filmora-for-smooth-meeting-operations/"><u>[New] Integrating Slack & Filmora for Smooth Meeting Operations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/updated-a-comprehensive-list-top-rated-srt-translation-services/"><u>[Updated] A Comprehensive List Top-Rated SRT Translation Services</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/updated-auditory-aesthetics-guide-media-sound-choices/"><u>[Updated] Auditory Aesthetics Guide Media Sound Choices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/updated-beyond-illusion-the-three-pillars-of-virtual-immersion-vr-ar-and-mr/"><u>[Updated] Beyond Illusion The Three Pillars of Virtual Immersion (VR, AR, & MR)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/updated-building-blocks-of-boosted-bots-elevating-bot-based-promotion/"><u>[Updated] Building Blocks of Boosted Bots Elevating Bot-Based Promotion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-solutions.techidaily.com/banish-launching-problems-expert-fixes-for-playing-monster-hunter-rise-smoothly/"><u>Banish Launching Problems: Expert Fixes for Playing Monster Hunter Rise Smoothly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/easy-steps-to-recover-deleted-music-from-infinix-hot-40i-by-fonelab-android-recover-music/"><u>Easy steps to recover deleted music from Infinix Hot 40i</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/elite-selection-of-10-a-list-camera-lenses/"><u>Elite Selection of 10 A-List Camera Lenses</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-android-lock-screen-using-emergency-call-on-xiaomi-redmi-12-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Bypass Android Lock Screen Using Emergency Call On Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://printer-issues.techidaily.com/how-to-connect-canon-printer-to-wifi-easily/"><u>How to Connect Canon Printer to Wifi Easily</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-use-device-manager-to-reinstall-your-drivers-on-windows-11-and-10-and-7-by-drivereasy-guide/"><u>How to use Device Manager to reinstall your drivers on Windows 11 & 10 & 7</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/no-monetary-investment-how-to-acquire-fcp/"><u>No Monetary Investment?

They were working fine, and now one of them won’t work when you pop it in your ear.</p><p>The first AirPod we put in our ears tends to cause us to get it by chance. When the other AirPod is inserted, we hear that switched-on chime and know that the issue has recurred. If you face one Airpod not working problem and are looking for possible fixes, you are in the right place. In this article, we will not only guide you on how you can diagnose the problem with your AirPods when one side isn’t working, but we will also tell you some possible fixes using which you can make both your Airpods work again.</p><hr><p><strong>You might be interested in:</strong></p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-call/how-to-facetime-on-android.html" >How to Use Facetime on Android(Everything About Using Facetime Links) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="One-AirPod-Not-Working-What-Could-Be-The-Reason"><a href="#One-AirPod-Not-Working-What-Could-Be-The-Reason" class="headerlink" title="One AirPod Not Working: What Could Be The Reason?"></a><strong>One AirPod Not Working: What Could Be The Reason?</strong></h2><p>If one side of your AirPods is not working properly, it is a clear indication that something is wrong with your AirPods.

It is very likely that the not working AirPod is dead, and that’s why it is not working now. When using AirPods, be mindful that the batteries of both sides of Airpods drain at different rates. So, when one side is not working, don’t forget to check your battery widget and charge the AirPods to make them work again.</p><h4 id="2-Clean-Your-AirPods"><a href="#2-Clean-Your-AirPods" class="headerlink" title="2. Clean Your AirPods"></a>2. Clean Your AirPods</h4><p>When you use the AirPods more frequently than it is common to have junk built up in it, it could also be the reason why you do not hear the sound on one side of your AirPods. Dust, Lint, and earwax can form a built-up in your AirPods over time and then can block the sound from getting out of your AirPods. As a result, you think that your AirPods are not working properly. So, there is a very simple fix to this problem. All you need to do is, check the AirPods to see if the speakers look clogged. If you find something clogged in your speakers, then clean them properly and use them again. They will work perfectly.</p><h4 id="3-Turn-Bluetooth-On-and-Off"><a href="#3-Turn-Bluetooth-On-and-Off" class="headerlink" title="3. Turn Bluetooth On and Off"></a>3.

In that case, a very simple fix could be trying to reset the Bluetooth. Just go to the settings in your iPhone or iPad and click on Bluetooth. Turn off the BlueTooth slider from Bluetooth settings and wait for a while. Now turn it back on and check again if the problem is fixed or not.</p><h4 id="4-Restart-Your-Device"><a href="#4-Restart-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="4. Restart Your Device"></a>4.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Minute-Drama-Framework-Plan"><a href="#Minute-Drama-Framework-Plan" class="headerlink" title="Minute Drama Framework Plan"></a>Minute Drama Framework Plan</h2><p>Short films are becoming more and more popular with seasoned filmmakers, breakout filmmakers, and students alike. Search on YouTube and you’ll find thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of short film examples. But what makes for a good short <a class="link"   href="https://blog.celtx.com/write-the-script-5-basic-steps/" >film script <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>? How can you make it stand out from the crowd?</p><p>Today, we look at seven important aspects of a great short film script and how you can improve yours. Can you put these into practice when writing your next script?</p><h2 id="Part-1-7-tips-for-improving-short-film-scripts"><a href="#Part-1-7-tips-for-improving-short-film-scripts" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. 7 tips for improving short film scripts"></a>Part 1. 7 tips for improving short film scripts</h2><p>There’s never been a better time to learn the craft of writing short film scripts. Interest and access to creating and viewing short films and series episodes have exploded worldwide, both on television and on the web. A great short film can also open doors for you into the film industry, as Barry Jenkins discovered with his great screenplay for the short film My Josephine, which I wrote in my screenwriting class at Florida State University.</p><p>But writing a successful short script is not easy. It requires the craft and concentration of a medieval artist carving scenes into walnut. So here are seven tips for creating a short script.</p><h3 id="1-Storyline"><a href="#1-Storyline" class="headerlink" title="1. Storyline"></a>1. Storyline</h3><p>This is always, always, the number one problem for my screenwriting students. They come up with big story ideas, often feature screenplay ideas, but quickly find that their idea doesn’t fit or work in short form. The result is what I call “narrative cramming.” The story can’t breathe. So, you need an idea that is small, specific, and significant to your main character.</p><p><strong><em>My Josephine</em></strong> was inspired by “an image of two people’s legs hanging over a table in my head,” according to Barry Jenkins. I saw them, young and intimate, working the night shift in a 24-hour laundry.” Even with this small, simple, and significant image as a starting point for a short script, Barry struggled to find a story in six pages that he could tell well. He attempted to include the murder in the Laundromat at one point, which resulted in, yes, narrative cramming. Barry rewrote the script a year later and “made it as simple as I could as a writer,” he told me. I was so moved by his transcript that I only wrote three words in the script – “Beautiful and gentle”. Just like his beautiful film.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1959712/19272" target="_top" id="1959712">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1959712" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1959712/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Characterization"><a href="#2-Characterization" class="headerlink" title="2. Characterization"></a>2. Characterization</h3><p>Writing compelling short scripts requires what Thornton Wilder called “shortcuts to the imagination.” And knowing what your main character wants in your story is the most important shortcut to understanding and discovering who your main character is. So, give your main character a desire or yearning for something that matters deeply to her. Then let your story flow from your character’s efforts to achieve that wish. The best stories, short or long, are about the human heart.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136613/26400" target="_top" id="2136613">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136613" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136613/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-An-independent-story"><a href="#3-An-independent-story" class="headerlink" title="3. An independent story"></a>3. An independent story</h3><p>It’s also a useful way to think of the script as an energy system, as William Gibson brilliantly says in Shakespeare’s play. An energy system begins with an Inciting Incident - a significant event&#x2F;discovery that unleashes the energy system - and ends with a Climax - the moment when the story’s outcome is known, and the energy system ends. Given the limited number of pages available in your short script, it’s essential that your inciting incident appears on the first page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/short-film-script-example-1.jpg"                      alt="an independent story"                ></p><h3 id="4-Conflict"><a href="#4-Conflict" class="headerlink" title="4.

And how these events forever change a character’s inner landscape is deep action—your character arc.</p><p>If you want to see a well-crafted surface and deep action&#x2F;character arc in a fifteen-page script, read Chapter 17 <em>“Killer Kart”</em> in the book Making Short Scripts That Connect 5e, and screen the movie on the book’s website.

So, it’s helpful to think of your scenes as the time and place where a significant moment of change will occur, throwing your script into the next scene and moving your story forward. That is your purpose when you write a scene, to dramatize the moment (or moments) of change. That’s what matters. I like to think of a scene as an oyster and a moment of change as a pearl. Then cut to your scenes as close to the moment of change as possible and exit as soon as possible.</p><p>I got it, really got it, as a young playwright when the Actors Theater of Louisville commissioned me to write a ten-minute play. And I did—in six scenes that I hit late and left early, each with a small but significant moment of change that moved the story into the next scene. “A tender and effortless glissando that gracefully stretches from moment to wistful moment,” as The Los Angeles Times put it in my all-time favorite review.</p><h3 id="7-Ending"><a href="#7-Ending" class="headerlink" title="7.

Characterization<p>Writing compelling short scripts requires what Thornton Wilder called “shortcuts to the imagination.” And knowing what your main character wants in your story is the most important shortcut to understanding and discovering who your main character is. So, give your main character a desire or yearning for something that matters deeply to her. Then let your story flow from your character’s efforts to achieve that wish. The best stories, short or long, are about the human heart.</p><h3 id="3-An-independent-story-1"><a href="#3-An-independent-story-1" class="headerlink" title="3. An independent story"></a>3. An independent story</h3><p>It’s also a useful way to think of the script as an energy system, as William Gibson brilliantly says in Shakespeare’s play. An energy system begins with an Inciting Incident - a significant event&#x2F;discovery that unleashes the energy system - and ends with a Climax - the moment when the story’s outcome is known, and the energy system ends. Given the limited number of pages available in your short script, it’s essential that your inciting incident appears on the first page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/short-film-script-example-1.jpg"                      alt="an independent story"                ></p><h3 id="4-Conflict-1"><a href="#4-Conflict-1" class="headerlink" title="4.
