Unfortunately, the app doesn’t offer any of the advanced watermarking features, and it doesn’t allow you to use your digital signature as a watermark.</p><h4 id="9-Visual-Watermark"><a href="#9-Visual-Watermark" class="headerlink" title="9. Visual Watermark"></a>9. <a class="link"   href="https://www.visualwatermark.com/" >Visual Watermark <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, pricing plans start at $19.95 for a lifetime license</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows, Android</p><p>The Visual Watermark software makes watermarking hundreds of photos in a short period of time look easy. Besides watermarking photos, you can also use the Visual Watermark application to add watermarks to videos. There are 260 fonts available, but you can also import your own custom-made fonts and use them to create watermarks. The software adjusts the size and the position of the watermark to each photo automatically, but you can also fine-tune each of these settings manually. Most importantly, the Visual Watermark software protects your images from artificial intelligence algorithms that remove watermarks from photos automatically by making minor changes to the template you’re applying to the photos you’re processing.</p><h4 id="10-Water-Marquee"><a href="#10-Water-Marquee" class="headerlink" title="10. Water Marquee"></a>10. <a class="link"   href="https://www.watermarquee.com/" >Water Marquee <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Web-based</p><p>This online watermarking tool enables you to create your own watermarks or use fully customizable templates to protect your images. The process of adding a watermark to a photo with Water Marquee is remarkably simple, as you just have to upload a photo to the platform and click on the Add Text, Add Logo or Use Template option. You can then proceed to insert the text, select its size, color or font and decide if you want to use a solid or transparent background. When done, simply click on the Save icon and choose the destination folder on your hard drive in which the watermarked photo is going to be stored.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>There is no way to control what happens to the photos you share on your website or on your social media accounts because people can share, repost or download them with a single click. The best way to reduce the chances of unsanctioned use of your work is to watermark all the pictures you share online. Which photo watermarking software do you use to copyright your photos?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Tiny-Film-Plot-Proposal"><a href="#Tiny-Film-Plot-Proposal" class="headerlink" title="Tiny Film Plot Proposal"></a>Tiny Film Plot Proposal</h2><p>Short films are becoming more and more popular with seasoned filmmakers, breakout filmmakers, and students alike. Search on YouTube and you’ll find thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of short film examples. But what makes for a good short <a class="link"   href="https://blog.celtx.com/write-the-script-5-basic-steps/" >film script <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>? How can you make it stand out from the crowd?</p><p>Today, we look at seven important aspects of a great short film script and how you can improve yours. Can you put these into practice when writing your next script?</p><h2 id="Part-1-7-tips-for-improving-short-film-scripts"><a href="#Part-1-7-tips-for-improving-short-film-scripts" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. 7 tips for improving short film scripts"></a>Part 1. 7 tips for improving short film scripts</h2><p>There’s never been a better time to learn the craft of writing short film scripts. Interest and access to creating and viewing short films and series episodes have exploded worldwide, both on television and on the web. A great short film can also open doors for you into the film industry, as Barry Jenkins discovered with his great screenplay for the short film My Josephine, which I wrote in my screenwriting class at Florida State University.</p><p>But writing a successful short script is not easy. It requires the craft and concentration of a medieval artist carving scenes into walnut. So here are seven tips for creating a short script.</p><h3 id="1-Storyline"><a href="#1-Storyline" class="headerlink" title="1. Storyline"></a>1. Storyline</h3><p>This is always, always, the number one problem for my screenwriting students. They come up with big story ideas, often feature screenplay ideas, but quickly find that their idea doesn’t fit or work in short form. The result is what I call “narrative cramming.” The story can’t breathe. So, you need an idea that is small, specific, and significant to your main character.</p><p><strong><em>My Josephine</em></strong> was inspired by “an image of two people’s legs hanging over a table in my head,” according to Barry Jenkins. I saw them, young and intimate, working the night shift in a 24-hour laundry.” Even with this small, simple, and significant image as a starting point for a short script, Barry struggled to find a story in six pages that he could tell well. He attempted to include the murder in the Laundromat at one point, which resulted in, yes, narrative cramming. Barry rewrote the script a year later and “made it as simple as I could as a writer,” he told me. I was so moved by his transcript that I only wrote three words in the script – “Beautiful and gentle”. Just like his beautiful film.</p><h3 id="2-Characterization"><a href="#2-Characterization" class="headerlink" title="2. Characterization"></a>2. Characterization</h3><p>Writing compelling short scripts requires what Thornton Wilder called “shortcuts to the imagination.” And knowing what your main character wants in your story is the most important shortcut to understanding and discovering who your main character is. So, give your main character a desire or yearning for something that matters deeply to her. Then let your story flow from your character’s efforts to achieve that wish. The best stories, short or long, are about the human heart.</p><h3 id="3-An-independent-story"><a href="#3-An-independent-story" class="headerlink" title="3. An independent story"></a>3. An independent story</h3><p>It’s also a useful way to think of the script as an energy system, as William Gibson brilliantly says in Shakespeare’s play. An energy system begins with an Inciting Incident - a significant event&#x2F;discovery that unleashes the energy system - and ends with a Climax - the moment when the story’s outcome is known, and the energy system ends. Given the limited number of pages available in your short script, it’s essential that your inciting incident appears on the first page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/short-film-script-example-1.jpg"                      alt="an independent story"                ></p><h3 id="4-Conflict"><a href="#4-Conflict" class="headerlink" title="4. Conflict"></a>4. Conflict</h3><p>Conflict is every point of opposition between two forces (physical or intellectual), as well as the consequences of this opposition - all in full view of what can be seen on the screen, whether through cinema, television, or devices.</p><p>Screenwriters can’t convey conflict with background and inner thoughts or explanations of inner thoughts—that’s literary conflict.</p><p>Instead, screenwriters are tasked with presenting the conflict on screen through scene descriptions, character actions and reactions, and dialogue. While the dialogue is something we hear and could certainly—in smaller print—be used to replace literary prose to describe background information, backstory, and inner thoughts, the best screenplays and movies show rather than tell.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/short-film-script-example-2.jpg"                      alt="conflict"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135402/19272" target="_top" id="2135402">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135402" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="336" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135402/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Turning-Point"><a href="#5-Turning-Point" class="headerlink" title="5. Turning Point"></a>5. Turning Point</h3><p>It’s helpful to think of a screenplay as a pattern of significant human change that you create at specific moments of change—the discoveries and decisions your main character makes that change the character and move the story forward. What your character wants and is trying to achieve in your short is the surface action – the events we see on screen. And how these events forever change a character’s inner landscape is deep action—your character arc.</p><p>If you want to see a well-crafted surface and deep action&#x2F;character arc in a fifteen-page script, read Chapter 17 <em>“Killer Kart”</em> in the book Making Short Scripts That Connect 5e, and screen the movie on the book’s website. It’s no surprise that the film is the most screened film ever made at the FSU Film School.</p><h3 id="6-Sublimation"><a href="#6-Sublimation" class="headerlink" title="6. Sublimation"></a>6. Sublimation</h3><p>Scenes are the <strong>“church of drama”</strong>, as William Gibson also brilliantly says. So, it’s helpful to think of your scenes as the time and place where a significant moment of change will occur, throwing your script into the next scene and moving your story forward. That is your purpose when you write a scene, to dramatize the moment (or moments) of change. That’s what matters. I like to think of a scene as an oyster and a moment of change as a pearl. Then cut to your scenes as close to the moment of change as possible and exit as soon as possible.</p><p>I got it, really got it, as a young playwright when the Actors Theater of Louisville commissioned me to write a ten-minute play. And I did—in six scenes that I hit late and left early, each with a small but significant moment of change that moved the story into the next scene. “A tender and effortless glissando that gracefully stretches from moment to wistful moment,” as The Los Angeles Times put it in my all-time favorite review.</p><h3 id="7-Ending"><a href="#7-Ending" class="headerlink" title="7. Ending"></a>7. Ending</h3><p>The end of a script is often more important than the 90 pages that preceded it. Because of the magnitude of its importance, many writers struggle to close their scripts with the right resolution. But don’t worry, we’ll show you everything you need to know about how to end a storyboard with examples of basic storyboard formats from Star Wars: <strong><em>The Force Awakens</em></strong> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596363/"><strong><em>The Big Short</em></strong></a>. We will discuss the technical aspects of writing THE END into scripts. By the end, you’ll have a good understanding of the formatting requirements for how to end the script.</p><p><strong>Example Script Defining Above Tips</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/short-film-script-example-3.jpg"                      alt="example script defining"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-edit-your-short-film"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-edit-your-short-film" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

And I did—in six scenes that I hit late and left early, each with a small but significant moment of change that moved the story into the next scene. “A tender and effortless glissando that gracefully stretches from moment to wistful moment,” as The Los Angeles Times put it in my all-time favorite review.</p><h3 id="7-Ending-1"><a href="#7-Ending-1" class="headerlink" title="7.

Researching all the numerous possibilities and choosing the appropriate service for you can be a mammoth process, leaving many people merely choosing one of the major brands, like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive. The regular SSD or hard drive can no longer suffice with the quantity of data that needs to be stored, so the only option is to subscribe to a possible cloud storage service. The best way to store data in the cloud is through cloud storage, accessed from any location and device.</p><p>We’ve evaluated all the various cloud storage out there and put up this cloud storage comparison to make the task simpler. If you want to save money on storage, <strong>cloud storage pricing</strong> is essential when choosing the best cloud storage service provider.</p><p>So, read on as we discuss <strong>cloud storage prices</strong> below:</p><h2 id="Part-1-Cloud-Storage-Pricing-Comparison"><a href="#Part-1-Cloud-Storage-Pricing-Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Cloud Storage Pricing Comparison"></a>Part 1: Cloud Storage Pricing Comparison</h2><p>Here is a table comparing top cloud storage providers’ free storage space and their <strong>cloud storage pricing comparison</strong>.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Cloud Storage Providers</th><th>Free Storage</th><th>Monthly Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Apple iCloud</td><td>5GB</td><td>50GB - $1200GB - $32TB - $10</td></tr><tr><td>Google Drive</td><td>15GB</td><td>100GB - $7.49250GB - $10500GB - $18.95</td></tr><tr><td>Amazon</td><td>5GB</td><td>100GB - $21TB - $72TB - $12</td></tr><tr><td>Microsoft</td><td>5GB</td><td>100GB of storage for $2 per month or $20 annually</td></tr><tr><td>Dropbox</td><td>2GB</td><td>Plus: 2TB - $10Family: 2TB - $17.</td></tr><tr><td>pCloud</td><td>10GB</td><td>500GB - $50 a year2TB - $100 a year10TB - Custom</td></tr><tr><td>Sync.com</td><td>5GB</td><td>1TB - $6Unlimited - $15</td></tr><tr><td>Icedrive</td><td>10GB</td><td>150GB - $1.671TB - $4.175TB - $15</td></tr></tbody></table><p>However, Google Drive and Photos are already fine if you don’t wish to invest much money. For example, you can use Google Photos to store photos in the cloud.</p><p>The security and privacy of cloud services are crucial, correct storage capacity and device compatibility.</p><p>If security is your top priority, choose Sync.com, IceDrive, and pCloud. They are the most robust encryption and authentication system for cloud storage.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Price-Recommendations"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Price-Recommendations" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best Price Recommendations"></a>Part 2: Best Price Recommendations</h2><p>Here we recommend the cloud storage services with the best prices in three categories.</p><h3 id="1-Best-price-of-lifetime-license-cloud-storage"><a href="#1-Best-price-of-lifetime-license-cloud-storage" class="headerlink" title="1.

The individual plans are as follows:</p><ul><li>500 GB of Premium storage costs $50.</li><li>2 TB of storage for Premium Plus costs $100.</li><li>10 TB storage for Custom storage.</li></ul><p><strong>#2.

Each offers three different cloud storage options (from the monthly subscription).</p><p>Here are the monthly <strong>cloud storage pricing</strong> packages.</p><ul><li>Lite: 150 GB of storage and 250 GB of bandwidth per month for $1.67</li><li>Pro: 1 TB of storage and 2 TB of bandwidth per month for $4.17.</li><li>Pro+: 5 TB of storage and 8 TB of monthly bandwidth per month for $15.</li></ul><p>Creating an account will grant you free access to 10 TB of storage!

Best price of unlimited cloud storage service"></a>2. Best price of unlimited cloud storage service</h3><p>For the best <strong>cloud storage prices</strong> for unlimited storage, here is a list of a few recommended cloud storage services.</p><p><strong>#1. Sync.com</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/cloud-storage-pricing-3.JPG"                      alt="sync.com"                ></p><p>The service offers one of the industry’s most excellent versioning systems, broad file-sharing functionality, outstanding security, and privacy.</p><p>Sync.com offers two plans for unlimited cloud storage service:</p><ul><li>Teams Standard Plan for 1TB of storage space costs $6 per month, billed annually</li><li>Teams Unlimited Plan for Unlimited storage space costs $15 per month, billed annually.</li><li>Enterprise plan – Custom pricing</li></ul><p><strong>#2. Dropbox</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/cloud-storage-pricing-4.JPG"                      alt="dropbox"                ></p><p>It established numerous file-sharing and syncing trends currently refined. Dropbox first used the sync-folder model, and this version is among the finest.</p><p>Dropbox offers two plans for unlimited cloud storage service:</p><ul><li>The Dropbox Plus plan for 2TB of storage space costs $10 monthly</li><li>The Dropbox Family Plan for 2TB storage space costs $17 monthly</li></ul><h3 id="3-Overall-cheapest-cloud-storage-service"><a href="#3-Overall-cheapest-cloud-storage-service" class="headerlink" title="3. Overall cheapest cloud storage service"></a>3. Overall cheapest cloud storage service</h3><p>You can use the following cloud service providers for the cheapest cloud storage pricing.</p><p><strong>#1. Sync.com</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/cloud-storage-pricing-5.JPG"                      alt="sync.com"                ></p><p>Sync.com comes out on top of our list of the best cloud storage options because the company emphasizes data protection while maintaining a high functionality level for more skilled users. The fact that it is encrypted from end to end implies that both its upload and download rates are rather sluggish. Because this is a zero-knowledge service, nobody but you will be able to decrypt your data. Even though there are no monthly plans available, the price of the service is relatively reasonable, which is a plus given the high level of protection it provides; yet, this absence may be inconvenient for specific customers.</p><p><strong>Pricing:</strong> 5GB for free, 1TB - $6; and Unlimited - $15</p><p><strong>#2. IceDrive</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/cloud-storage-pricing-6.JPG"                      alt="icedrive"                ></p><p>IceDrive, a cloud storage newcomer in the United Kingdom, may not yet have the power and polish of the leading competitors. Still, the firm already has more than enough cool features to take a cautious look.

However, the requirements and evaluation standards you employ when selecting a cloud provider will be particular to your business. So, any service provider evaluation will often concentrate on a few critical criteria.</p><p><strong>1. Authorities and Standards</strong></p><p>The adherence to industry best practices and standards is demonstrated by providers who follow recognized standards and quality frameworks. Measures can be pretty valuable for narrowing down the pool of potential suppliers, even though they might not ultimately influence which service provider you select.</p><p><strong>2. Locking of Cloud Data</strong></p><p>It is reasonable to worry about becoming bound to a specific cloud vendor. As <strong>cloud storage prices</strong> become increasingly popular and affordable, more applications support the most widely used cloud services. Thus, seeking applications adopting a multi-cloud data strategy is advisable to guarantee that freedom. There are now multi-cloud data management tools that enable clients to select between avoiding cloud vendor lock-in and application separation from specific cloud storage providers.</p><p><strong>3. Access Cost and Speed</strong></p><p>Organizations must consider two key aspects of data access to cloud services: speed and affordability. Understanding cloud storage providers’ service-level agreements (SLAs) is essential for speed. Generally speaking, the storage business can loosen its guarantees regarding access speed the more affordable the storage is. This is especially true for cloud archive storage, which costs very little, where the SLA for data access is expressed in hours.</p><h2 id="Part-4-FAQs"><a href="#Part-4-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: FAQs"></a>Part 4: FAQs</h2><h3 id="1-How-can-I-get-100GB-for-free"><a href="#1-How-can-I-get-100GB-for-free" class="headerlink" title="1.

Because this is a zero-knowledge service, nobody but you will be able to decrypt your data. Even though there are no monthly plans available, the price of the service is relatively reasonable, which is a plus given the high level of protection it provides; yet, this absence may be inconvenient for specific customers.</p><p><strong>Pricing:</strong> 5GB for free, 1TB - $6; and Unlimited - $15</p><p><strong>#2.

That’s why many filmmakers, editors, and colorists working on film use Look Up Tables, or LUTs, to store color grades as templates to help speed up the process.</p><p>We’re letting you know that you don’t have to work on the film to use LUTs to help personalize and mark your videos. If you’re wondering how you can get started with color grading to speed up your workflow and create better-looking shots for your business, we’ve got you covered.</p><p><strong>LUTs in Movies</strong></p><p>Various LUT types are employed during post-production for color grading and color correction.</p><p>First, the two LUT formats work differently. <strong>A 1D LUT</strong> (usually. lut format) controls a single parameter, generally gamma. A 1D LUT takes a sort of blanket approach; the adjustment applies to everything in the image without much flexibility. One parameter affects all colors, saturations, and contrast. <strong>A 3D LUT</strong> (usually a. cube format) has three axes that independently adjust Hue, Saturation, Luminance, Gamma, and Contrast and can change as conditions in the image change. As such, a 3D LUT is much more flexible and powerful and is the only way to achieve a truly cinematic color grade with LUT.</p><p>The other two types of LUTs can be either 1D or 3D LUTs, but these days they are most often 3D LUTs. The difference between them is when in the process you use them and for what purpose.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-grading-central-3.jpg"                      alt="luts in movies"                ></p><p>An input or camera LUT used at the beginning of the color correction process adjusts the footage so that the color correction tools work correctly. Color corrected recordings that require an input or camera LUT without one can lead to unexpected and unsatisfactory results.</p><p>Conversely, you typically apply a LUT look after you’ve done color correction and moved on to the color grading phase. Use it to dial in the exact artistic look you want. The Look LUT contains instructions to create a predetermined desired look for your shots, which can be an incredible time saver in the color grading process.</p><p>Always colorize an appearance LUT correctly before applying it, as appearance LUTs assume an underlying natural color. If you don’t, you may not see the results that the LUT is supposed to give you.</p><p>LUTs are specially designed for different recording types – LOG, RAW, Rec.709, Rec.2020, HDR, and more. You can apply any LUT to any footage, but if you apply a LUT designed for a specific type of footage to another type, you can end up with a very different look than what you expected. But then it can also give you a result you like, so you are free to experiment as you wish. LUTs are non-destructive, so you can load and delete them at will.</p><p>Many camera manufacturers, software companies, and independent producers offer downloadable LUTs or LUT packs. They often design these skins for specific purposes, such as color correcting footage captured by their cameras or to mimic signature skins seen in movies and TV shows. These skins can give you exactly the color class you want, or you can use them and keep tweaking and tweaking to get the perfect look.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Free-LUTs-sources"><a href="#Part-3-Free-LUTs-sources" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Free LUTs sources"></a>Part 3. Free LUTs sources</h2><p>Cinematic LUTs are pre-saved settings that make color grading easy and efficient, allowing you to enhance your videos with just a few clicks. By using a color tinting effect, changing the brightness of the video, or richer colors, you will achieve professional results in no time, regardless of the software product you are using.</p><p>LUTs are shared in the .cube file format, which is supported by the most popular video editors, such as DaVinci Resolve, Premiere Pro CC, After Effects CC, and Sony Vegas.</p><h3 id="1-Ground-Control-Color-13-Free-LUTs"><a href="#1-Ground-Control-Color-13-Free-LUTs" class="headerlink" title="1.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Haste-Assessment-of-Windows-Documents"><a href="#Haste-Assessment-of-Windows-Documents" class="headerlink" title="Haste Assessment of Windows Documents"></a>Haste Assessment of Windows Documents</h2><p>Windows operating system comes with an inbuilt file preview feature embedded in Explorer. This feature lets you preview documents and images before uploading them on apps like Skype, Facebook, and more. But what happens if you want to preview videos, audio, spreadsheets, ZIP, and more? In that case, install <strong>QuickLook for Windows</strong>. So, what exactly is <strong>QuickLook for Windows 10,</strong> and where can you get this app? For answers and more, read to the end.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Download-Quick-Look-App-on-Microsoft-Store"><a href="#Part-1-Download-Quick-Look-App-on-Microsoft-Store" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Download Quick Look App on Microsoft Store"></a>Part 1: Download Quick Look App on Microsoft Store</h2><p>If your computer is always handling documents, spreadsheets, PDFs, presentations, images, and other files, it’s probably time to install <strong>QuickLook for Mac</strong> and Windows. This intelligent program lets you quickly preview files without opening them on separate apps. Just think of it as the “file viewer” feature on Windows File Explorer, which allows you to view files before loading online or opening them on local apps. Of course, this can help you know which app can open the file and if it’s the correct file to open.</p><p>But although the inbuilt file viewer is excellent to use, it has limited capabilities. For example, you cannot preview zipped files. Also, this inbuilt function cannot preview media files like audio and video. For this reason, install QuickLook for Windows and preview everything on your PC. And by the way, it’s absolutely free to use and comes bundled with a media player to open compatible video and audio formats.</p><p>Below is how to install and use QuickLook by Paddy Xu:</p><p>Step1 Open Microsoft Store and search for QuickLook. Make sure you select the option published by Paddy Xu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/quicklook-for-windows-1.jpg"                      alt="search for quicklook for windows on Microsoft store"                ></p><p>Step2 Once you find QuickLook, click “Get it” to download and install the app in your Windows operating system. At around 60MB, installing this preview app should be quick and easy.</p><p>Step3 After successfully installing QuickLook, head to File Explorer and select any file you want to preview. Press the “Space” bar on your keyboard to view the file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/quicklook-for-windows-2.jpg"                      alt="preview video on quicklook for windows"                ></p><p>Unfortunately, you won’t preview the content inside the document file. Instead, you’ll only see details like the file type&#x2F;format, size, image name, and more. You can also directly choose the opening app. As for videos and audio, the media file will automatically play on the QuickLook media player. But don’t fret because the following section will teach you to read your documents, presentations, PDFs, and other files on QuickLook without opening the file.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Get-the-App-on-GitHub"><a href="#Part-2-Get-the-App-on-GitHub" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Get the App on GitHub"></a>Part 2: Get the App on GitHub</h2><p>If you can’t find QuickLook on Microsoft Store for one reason or another, download the program from GitHub. It’s an open-source community where millions of software developers converge to distribute and share their work. Here, you can download and install multiple desktop programs and plugins for free. However, you must be a registered member to contribute any content.</p><p>So, without wasting time, let’s go through the steps to download the QuickLook plugin from GitHub. Follow me!</p><p>Step1 Visit the <a class="link"   href="https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook" >QuickLook GitHub <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> page and then navigate to Releases. Click the latest version.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/quicklook-for-windows-3.jpg"                      alt="click the latest quicklook for windows version"                ></p><p>Step2 Scroll down and download the .msi file. After downloading the installation file successfully, install it on your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/quicklook-for-windows-4.jpg"                      alt="install the quicklook for windows msi"                ></p><p>Step3 Now go back to the QuickLook GitHub home page and click <a class="link"   href="https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook/wiki/Available-Plugins" >plugin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Then, download the plugins to add additional preview capabilities to Microsoft QuickLook. For example, install the FontViewer, FFmpeg, and OfficeViewer plugins by clicking the respective “Link” buttons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/quicklook-for-windows-5.jpg"                      alt="install quicklook for windows plugins"                ></p><p>Step4 After a successful installation, find the file you want to preview and select it. Then, tap the space bar to preview the files. And remember, browse ZIP files to view all content.</p><p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: We recommend installing the QuickLook OfficeViewer plugin to rip open your Office files and view the content inside. This method is recommended if you haven’t installed Microsoft Office on your PC. However, you might notice that the OfficeViewer plugin isn’t supported on your Windows PC. So to install OfficeViewer, select the file and click the space bar to preview it on QuickLook. Then, tap the “Click here to install this plugin” button. Now restart QuickLook and view all your office documents without opening them on their respective programs.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Should-We-Expect-Built-in-Quick-Look-on-Windows-in-the-Future"><a href="#Part-3-Should-We-Expect-Built-in-Quick-Look-on-Windows-in-the-Future" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Should We Expect Built-in Quick Look on Windows in the Future?"></a>Part 3: Should We Expect Built-in Quick Look on Windows in the Future?</h2><p>Mac users have enjoyed the powerful QuickLook capabilities for at least 15 years. But are we going to see QuickLook coming to Windows 10&#x2F;11 anytime soon? According to sources, plans are already underway to add this feature to Microsoft Windows and rename it Peek. After selecting a file on Explorer, simply tap the Shift + Space bar to preview the content. Like the macOS version, you can preview PDFs, Excels, Words, images, videos, audio, and pretty much anything.</p><p>Meanwhile, it’s expected that QuickLook will come with a small preview screen. However, that should be enough space to preview whatever file you’re searching for. Also, it’s expected that Windows will embed the QuickLook capabilities into the Photos app. But it’s not yet clear if Peek will work with media files like videos and audio as it is on Mac.</p><p>In other related news, Microsoft will be answering the prayers of their loyal patrons to get tabbed browsing. This is another feature similar to what you currently have on macOS, where you can open new tabs for numerous file locations. In return, this makes moving and copying files more straightforward. This easy-to-navigate addition will definitely make Microsoft Windows users more productive than before.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934288/19272" target="_top" id="1934288">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934288" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934288/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Frequently-Asked-Questions"><a href="#Part-4-Frequently-Asked-Questions" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Frequently Asked Questions"></a>Part 4: Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h4 id="1-Which-digital-file-formats-are-compatible-with-QuickLook"><a href="#1-Which-digital-file-formats-are-compatible-with-QuickLook" class="headerlink" title="1. Which digital file formats are compatible with QuickLook?"></a>1. Which digital file formats are compatible with QuickLook?</h4><p>Microsoft QuickLook supports a host of file formats. For image formats, you can preview PNG, APNG, JPG, GIF, PSD, and MP4. You can also preview media files like MP3, M4A, MP4, MOV, AVI, WMV, and more. And, of course, QuickLook supports all sorts of document files, including PDF and CSV. You can even open and preview ZIP files.</p><h4 id="2-Can-Microsoft-QuickLook-open-E-books"><a href="#2-Can-Microsoft-QuickLook-open-E-books" class="headerlink" title="2. Can Microsoft QuickLook open E-books?"></a>2. Can Microsoft QuickLook open E-books?</h4><p>Unfortunately, Microsoft QuickLook doesn’t offer native support for E-books. But thankfully, you can install the <a class="link"   href="https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook.Plugin.EpubViewer/releases" >EpubViewer plugin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and view all E-books. You’ll also get QuickLook plugins for viewing 3D models, Android APK, folders, shape files, and more.</p><h4 id="3-Can-QuickLook-for-Mac-edit-files"><a href="#3-Can-QuickLook-for-Mac-edit-files" class="headerlink" title="3. Can QuickLook for Mac edit files?"></a>3. Can QuickLook for Mac edit files?</h4><p>Now this is one of the primary advantages of using the Mac QuickLook. You can trim video and audio clips, rotate photos, and use markups directly on the program. We hope that the Windows version will add these convenient features as well.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://smilemakers.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123899/26106" target="_top" id="2123899">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26106-2123899" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://smilemakers.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123899/26106"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This guidepost is another testament that your PC has massive hidden abilities.

In case of Gear 360 you will be able to enjoy 4K resolution whereas LG 360 serves with 2K resolution only thus <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Samsung Gear 360 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will be better choice in this case. On the other side if we talk about audio abilities then LG360 has an edge over Samsung Gear 360 because of its ability to record 5.1 level surround sounds that is major requirement of a 360 degree video. The Gear 360 possess stereo record feature that can capture voice only in two directions thus resultant audio in scenes is not that much clear. Moving forward to more technical specifications, the bit rate – well known as quality of image with resolution is 60MB&#x2F;second in case of Gear 360 whereas LG360 cam limits up to 19MB&#x2F;second, this makes a big difference in quality. If we count features then Samsung gear 360 definitely have more features as like its waterproof body, highly stabilized video results and F2.0 dual lenses but LG360 lacks behind in these features.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Editing-software-comparison-comparison"><a href="#Part-4-Editing-software-comparison-comparison" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 Editing software comparison comparison"></a>Part 4 Editing software comparison comparison</h2><p>It is possible to stitch videos as well as photographs taken from the 360 degree camera using Galaxy phone and they can be directly shared on social media. Some consumers also love to use Desktop software to edit the camera results in detail. Same as like Gear 360, the latest device from LG can also capture good quality 360 degree videos as well as photographs but it do not support spherical share as like Samsung unit. You can pair up LG360 cam only with LG G5 latest smartphone whereas video and photo editing options are not yet known for smartphone as well as PC. Both these devices come with Wi-Fi connectivity, USB port and Bluetooth capabilities whereas in case of Samsung 360 gear NFC is an additional option. The ultimate combination of time lapse recording, 360 spherical recording and loop recording makes everything easy in Samsung gear where you can avail wonderful results for each real time recording.</p><p>Check this side-by-side video review to know more about this two 360 degree cameras:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1975807/19272" target="_top" id="1975807">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1975807" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1975807/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-5-Conclusion"><a href="#Part-5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 Conclusion"></a>Part 5 Conclusion</h2><p>Price difference of both devices is well reflected in the comparison table above and you got enough information about their features too. The gear 360 results better looking images along with better color distributions but in case of LG the image as well as video quality is comparatively degraded; Although, LG cam is much faster and discrete design but for professional photographers it will not result better output. The two additional shooting modes of Gear 360 also allows better quality of videos and its compatibility with Samsung smartphones allows easy editing and uploading. After getting real time users recommendations and their reviews, users are advised to prefer Samsung GEAR 360 for their Virtual Reality needs but those who cannot compromise for price range can go for LG360 device as its audio quality is much better than Samsung gear 360 along with ability to connect with Android as well as iOS devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139107/17108" target="_top" id="2139107">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139107" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139107/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-fast-tracking-music-in-spotify-efficiency-and-security-in-harmony/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Fast-Tracking Music in Spotify Efficiency & Security in Harmony</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-harness-youtubes-power-25-steps-to-prominence-and-recognition/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Harness YouTube's Power 25 Steps to Prominence and Recognition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/new-achieving-professional-grade-motion-blur-using-photoshop-tools/"><u>[New] Achieving Professional-Grade Motion Blur Using Photoshop Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-step-by-step-guide-to-personalize-and-change-video-covers-on-facebook/"><u>2024 Approved Step-by-Step Guide to Personalize and Change Video Covers on Facebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/4-solution-to-get-rid-of-pokemon-fail-to-detect-location-on-apple-iphone-11-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>4 solution to get rid of pokemon fail to detect location On Apple iPhone 11 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/delicious-directives-the-7-secrets-of-epic-food-vids/"><u>Delicious Directives The 7 Secrets of Epic Food Vids</u></a></li><li><a href="https://solve-help.techidaily.com/easy-methods-for-transforming-wmv-videos-to-mp4-with-the-power-of-ffmpeg/"><u>Easy Methods for Transforming WMV Videos to MP4 with the Power of FFmpeg</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/factory-reset-on-apple-iphone-7-plus-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/"><u>Factory Reset on Apple iPhone 7 Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/from-everyday-use-to-extraordinary-virtual-adventures-smartphone-vr-conversion-guide/"><u>From Everyday Use to Extraordinary Virtual Adventures Smartphone-VR Conversion Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/how-zooming-up-with-fb-live-transforms-broadcasts/"><u>How Zooming Up with FB Live Transforms Broadcasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/ignite-a-sizzling-online-presence-with-these-instagram-9-strategies-for-2024/"><u>Ignite a Sizzling Online Presence with These Instagram #9 Strategies for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-accelerating-operations-discover-the-leading-scheduling-tools/"><u>In 2024, Accelerating Operations Discover the Leading Scheduling Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/lullabies-of-relaxation-prime-asmr-talents/"><u>Lullabies of Relaxation Prime ASMR Talents</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/quick-steps-to-clear-the-exterior-of-your-photos-in-affinity/"><u>Quick Steps to Clear the Exterior of Your Photos in Affinity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/ultimate-free-drawing-tools-top-mac-apps-listed/"><u>Ultimate Free Drawing Tools Top Mac Apps Listed</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Unveiling-the-Best-A-Compact-Guide-to-2024’S-Top-10-Lens-Selections"><a href="#Unveiling-the-Best-A-Compact-Guide-to-2024’S-Top-10-Lens-Selections" class="headerlink" title="Unveiling the Best: A Compact Guide to 2024’S Top 10 Lens Selections"></a>Unveiling the Best: A Compact Guide to 2024’S Top 10 Lens Selections</h2><p>One of the first creative choices made during the photographic process is choosing a camera lens. There are a seemingly limitless number of alternatives available, and your decision will have a significant impact on your photos. The introduction of mirrorless prompted the demand for lenses that matched the new formats.</p><p>Initially, while manufacturers like Canon, Fuji, Nikon, Olympus, Panasonic, and Sony expanded their line of native lenses for those formats, photographers were dependent on adapters to fit legacy lenses from brands like Canon and Nikon to the APS-C, full-frame, and micro four-thirds mirrorless cameras. Additionally, independent lens producers like Sigma and Tamron continue to be crucial in supplying the demands of photographers looking for the greatest camera lens. Let’s start off!</p><h2 id="1-What-should-you-look-for-when-buying-a-lens"><a href="#1-What-should-you-look-for-when-buying-a-lens" class="headerlink" title="1. What should you look for when buying a lens?"></a>1. What should you look for when buying a lens?</h2><p>There are a number of factors to think about while looking for the best camera lens. Knowing how you’ll use the lens is just as crucial as ensuring sure it’s available and compatible with your camera’s mount (or that an adapter is available). Are you trying to find the best portrait lens? Or perhaps you’re looking for the best lens for landscape photography. Or maybe you prefer taking pictures of little objects, in which case you’ll need a macro lens. There are (nearly) universal, all-encompassing circumstances, of course. Just keep in mind that neither the greatest lens for landscape photography nor the finest lens for astrophotography will inevitably be the ideal choice for macro photography.</p><p>Regardless of the lens you select, the effective focal length’s relationship to the sensor size is a crucial consideration. Because the sensor on full-frame cameras is the same size as a 35mm film strip, this is not a problem. However, you must consider the crop factor if you’re using an APS-C or micro four thirds camera. A 100mm lens will provide a field of view of 150mm when used with an APS-C camera, which will crop the frame by 1.5x or 1.6x (depending on the model) (35mm equivalent). It simply captures a smaller portion of the image produced by the lens, giving the impression that the image is zoomed in. The effective focal length will double with a micro four thirds sensor, giving a 100mm lens a 200mm (35mm equivalent) field of view. This is typically not an issue with telephoto lenses because you want a larger focal length, but it’s crucial to keep in mind with wide-angle lenses so make sure to conduct some calculations before choosing one.</p><p>The cost of a camera lens is affected by some aspects. A lens with a quicker (lower f-number) maximum aperture will cost more than one with f&#x2F;stops that start with a slower maximum aperture, such f&#x2F;3.5. For longer, heavier lenses, optical image stabilization—also known as SteadyShot, vibration reduction, or simply OIS or OS—is crucial. Invisible elements like the caliber of the glass, the kinds of coatings used on the surfaces, and the weather sealing are also important.</p><p>In the absence of other factors, some minor extras like the presence of a lens hood, a manual aperture ring, a carrying case, and other bonuses may influence your decision. but shouldn’t determine the outcome of your decision.</p><h2 id="2-What-are-some-good-and-robust-lenses"><a href="#2-What-are-some-good-and-robust-lenses" class="headerlink" title="2. What are some good and robust lenses?"></a>2. What are some good and robust lenses?</h2><p>Focal length is one of the most important factors for picking the best camera lens and producing a nice photo while taking portraits of individuals or even very small groups. Generally speaking, a short telephoto lens is good, especially for tight compositions (headshots, waist level&#x2F;head and shoulders, etc.)—an 85mm or 105mm, for instance. If you can’t back up and shoot wide, you might want to go as wide as 70mm or 50mm for full-body and larger group images in order to minimize distortion.</p><h3 id="Nikon-Z-14-24mm-f-2-8-S"><a href="#Nikon-Z-14-24mm-f-2-8-S" class="headerlink" title="Nikon Z 14-24mm f&#x2F;2.8 S"></a><strong>Nikon Z 14-24mm f&#x2F;2.8 S</strong></h3><p>The premium Z 14-24mm f&#x2F;2.8 S lens, made for full-frame Nikon Z-series cameras, offers superb edge-to-edge sharpness for landscape photography. The aspherical lenses on the small lens are perfect for maintaining the sharpness of stars and city lights. Additionally, there are two ways to install filters: a slot for filter sheets and gels at the back and 112mm filters that may be screwed into the front.</p><p>Other choices for ultra-wide-angle lenses for full-frame cameras include the Sony FE 12-24mm f&#x2F;2.8 G Master. This camera lens is intriguing, albeit expensive, because it offers a little extra coverage starting at 12mm and maintains a consistent aperture throughout the zoom.</p><p>The 14–24mm f&#x2F;2.8 art series lens from Sigma is available in two variations. One is for DSLRs from Canon or Nikon, while the other is for mirrorless cameras from Sony and L-mount.</p><h3 id="Zeiss-Milvus-21mm-f-2-8"><a href="#Zeiss-Milvus-21mm-f-2-8" class="headerlink" title="Zeiss Milvus 21mm f&#x2F;2.8"></a><strong>Zeiss Milvus 21mm f&#x2F;2.8</strong></h3><p>The Zeiss Milvus 21mm f&#x2F;2.8 is the first lens up, a costly manual focus prime lens with a small but devoted fan base. The only true bells and whistles this lens has are the “Zeiss” moniker, and I’m sure many photographers wonder if it lives up to the $1843 price tag in any other manner.</p><p>I must admit that I would never purchase this lens for myself, but to me, it does. Nevertheless, it is one of the sharpest wide angles I’ve ever tested, and unlike many of the other lenses on this list, it accepts filters (82mm size).</p><h3 id="Sigma-60-600mm-f-4-5-6-3"><a href="#Sigma-60-600mm-f-4-5-6-3" class="headerlink" title="Sigma 60-600mm f&#x2F;4.5-6.3"></a><strong>Sigma 60-600mm f&#x2F;4.5-6.3</strong></h3><p>This 60-600mm super telephoto zoom is perfect for wildlife since it is wide enough to capture visitors to the bird feeder outside your back door or a pod of dolphins surfing the bow waves of a boat while still being long enough to capture the most elusive lioness and her pups on a picture safari. This image-stabilized lens, which is offered for Nikon, Canon, and Sigma, includes a tripod collar and is dust- and splash-proof.</p><p>The Sony FE 200-600mm f&#x2F;5.6 has Sony’s outstanding SteadyShot image stabilization, making it a great lens for Sony photographers. Although we typically advise zooms for wildlife photography, don’t discount some of the primes available. For instance, Canon’s EOS R mirrorless system is compatible with the Canon RF600mm f&#x2F;11 IS STM lens. Even though it only has an f&#x2F;11 maximum aperture, it should still function properly in well-lit environments.</p><p>Although you might need to increase the ISO to obtain a quick shutter speed, this lens is less expensive than other extreme telephoto lenses.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082535/7443" target="_top" id="2082535">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082535" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082535/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Rokinon-14mm-f-2-4"><a href="#Rokinon-14mm-f-2-4" class="headerlink" title="Rokinon 14mm f&#x2F;2.4"></a><strong>Rokinon 14mm f&#x2F;2.4</strong></h3><p>For a couple reasons, I chose the lesser-known Rokinon 14mm f&#x2F;2.4 lens over the Sigma 14mm f&#x2F;1.8. First, it costs half as much ($800) and is substantially lighter (719 vs. 1170 grams). These two elements alone make this lens more appealing to many photographers.</p><p>Second, the Rokinon 14mm f&#x2F;2.4 has outstanding image quality. When I used it, I didn’t get a chance to directly compare it to the Sigma 14mm f&#x2F;1.8, but I did evaluate how it performed when I photographed the Milky Way, which is likely the most demanding scenario. I accomplished this by comparing it to four other top 14mm lenses. With virtually no coma and perfect sharpness even when wide open, it defeated all of them.</p><p>This is a fantastic option for shooting landscapes in addition to stars. Although it lacks autofocus, the 14mm focal length makes it either the best or second-best lens on our list in terms of image quality. And once more, the Sigma 14mm f&#x2F;1.8, which is the closest rival in that sense, is twice as expensive.</p><h3 id="Tamron-15-30mm-f-2-8"><a href="#Tamron-15-30mm-f-2-8" class="headerlink" title="Tamron 15-30mm f&#x2F;2.8"></a><strong>Tamron 15-30mm f&#x2F;2.8</strong></h3><p>The Tamron 15-30mm f&#x2F;2.8 is one of my favorite wide-angle lenses that I’ve ever used. Although it is weighty, the Nikon 14-24mm f&#x2F;2.8 matches or even outperforms it in terms of overall image quality. It also comes with some contemporary features, such as vibration reduction and a front element that repels water. The telephoto range is where it loses some strength, like the Nikon (see our review), but even there it performs better than others.</p><p>The pricing is the actual incentive to get this lens instead. Additionally, there is a previous model with nearly comparable image quality that is available for even better used pricing. It costs $1200 new and even less used.</p><p>Tamron lenses don’t extend all the way to 14mm (closer to 15.5mm instead). Although the increase in focal length to 30mm is good, we believe that most of this lens’ potential customers would be more interested in the wide end of things. Additionally, similar to the Nikon 14-24mm f&#x2F;2.8, it doesn’t come with built-in filter support, so if that’s crucial to your photography, you’ll need a hefty attachment.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886019/19272" target="_top" id="1886019">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886019" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886019/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tamron-17-35mm-f-2-8-4"><a href="#Tamron-17-35mm-f-2-8-4" class="headerlink" title="Tamron 17-35mm f&#x2F;2.8-4"></a><strong>Tamron 17-35mm f&#x2F;2.8-4</strong></h3><p>This lens is a recent addition to our list, and several people have asked why I didn’t include it in the comments. I’ve only lately had a chance to really test the Tamron 17-35mm f&#x2F;2.8-4, and I think it’s a great lens. First of all, it offers an excellent price of $600 and excellent image quality.</p><p>It is lightweight and has an f&#x2F;2.8 maximum aperture, making it ideal for astrophotography. This all comes together to provide a pretty remarkable package. In spite of the fact that corner sharpness isn’t nearly as good as it could be compared to certain other lenses on this list, the Tamron 17-35mm f&#x2F;2.8-4 doesn’t really have many drawbacks to speak about. But that’s hardly a criticism of this lens. It’s one of the first I’d look at if I needed a wide-angle zoom for a Nikon.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2080312/19272" target="_top" id="2080312">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2080312" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2080312/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Nikon-20mm-f-1-8"><a href="#Nikon-20mm-f-1-8" class="headerlink" title="Nikon 20mm f&#x2F;1.8"></a><strong>Nikon 20mm f&#x2F;1.8</strong></h3><p>It is sharper than all of the zooms on this list at 20mm, with the possible exception of the 14-30mm f&#x2F;4. And assuming you don’t require the 14mm focal length for your Milky Way work, it’s better than practically every lens above for astrophotography thanks to its f&#x2F;1.8 aperture.</p><h2 id="3-What-lenses-are-good-for-nighttime"><a href="#3-What-lenses-are-good-for-nighttime" class="headerlink" title="3.

This has an excellent build quality and a quick f&#x2F;2.8 aperture, which are its biggest advantages.</p><p>This focus range, also known as the “walk-around lens,” may be used to shoot whatever you could possibly want, including tight portraits and landscapes. The f&#x2F;1.8 lenses that we described at the beginning of this post are one stop slower than f&#x2F;2.8. However, the Canon 24-70mm f&#x2F;2.8L II has a number of qualities that make it a fantastic lens for shooting in low light.</p><h3 id="Sigma-35mm-f-1-2-DG-DN-Art-Lens"><a href="#Sigma-35mm-f-1-2-DG-DN-Art-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Sigma 35mm f&#x2F;1.2 DG DN Art Lens"></a><strong>Sigma 35mm f&#x2F;1.2 DG DN Art Lens</strong></h3><p>Amazing glass is the Sigma 35mm f&#x2F;1.2 DG DN Art Lens. With a maximum aperture of f&#x2F;1.2, the widest an autofocusing lens can go, it offers excellent results. Since the lens includes a floating mechanism, focusing up close as well as throughout the remainder of the focusing range will be simple.</p><p>One “F” Low Dispersion Element, also known as a FLD element, and four Super-Low Dispersion glass elements make up the lens. This substance functions very similarly to a fluorite coating. There are also two spherical components. Together, these components make sure that chromatic aberration and distortion are minimized in the lens.</p><p>The lens also features a Super-Multi-Layer coating on top of it. This reduces flares and ghosting while enhancing the image’s sharpness and saturation. The Sigma 35mm f&#x2F;1.4 DG HSM Art lens is available for DSLR cameras, although it is only available for mirrorless systems.</p><h3 id="Sony-FE-14mm-f-1-8-GM-Lens"><a href="#Sony-FE-14mm-f-1-8-GM-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Sony FE 14mm f&#x2F;1.8 GM Lens"></a><strong>Sony FE 14mm f&#x2F;1.8 GM Lens</strong></h3><p>The Sony FE 14mm f&#x2F;1.8 GM Lens is the last item on our list, but surely not the least! The G-Master is your best pal if you own a Sony mirrorless camera. The most expensive lenses you can purchase directly from Sony are in their GM range, which includes the well-liked Sony FE 14mm f&#x2F;1.8 GM Lens.</p><p>This lens’s wide focal length and fantastic f&#x2F;1.8 aperture make it a handy tool for astrophotography.

The lens has an aperture ring, a focus distance indication, and a manual focus ring.Flares and ghosting are handled by the lens’ Super Integrated Coating. The 50mm is versatile since it has a physical ring that regulates the aperture and a manual focusing ring.</p><h2 id="4-What-are-good-micro-lenses"><a href="#4-What-are-good-micro-lenses" class="headerlink" title="4.

Ring- type ultrasonic autofocus and a three-position autofocus limiter switch, which can shut off the short or long end of the range, are typical high-end attractions.</p><p>The lens also contains an Ultra-low Dispersion element and weather sealing. Even at f&#x2F;22, image quality is superb throughout the whole aperture range, allowing you to squeeze out a bit extra depth of field. For the majority of macro photography, the manual focus ring is more crucial than the autofocus since it is smooth and precise.</p><h3 id="Tokina-atx-i-100mm-F2-8-FF-Macro"><a href="#Tokina-atx-i-100mm-F2-8-FF-Macro" class="headerlink" title="Tokina atx-i 100mm F2.8 FF Macro"></a><strong>Tokina atx-i 100mm F2.8 FF Macro</strong></h3><p>The AT-X PRO 100mm macro lens from Tokina was introduced back in 2006. In 2019, the replacement atx-i (interactive) model hit the market with a new design that gives the lens a more modern appearance. However, appearances can be deceiving, because the newcomer uses the same optical path with two aspherical and two Super-Low Dispersion glass elements as the original.</p><p>The fact that only the Canon mount version includes an autofocus motor and that it has an expanding inner barrel that extends longer at closer focusing distances are other similarities. The image quality is excellent, with outstanding sharpness levels, little distortion, and barely detectable lateral chromatic aberration.</p><h3 id="Nikon-Z-MC-105mm-f-2-8-VR-S"><a href="#Nikon-Z-MC-105mm-f-2-8-VR-S" class="headerlink" title="Nikon Z MC 105mm f&#x2F;2.8 VR S"></a><strong>Nikon Z MC 105mm f&#x2F;2.8 VR S</strong></h3><p>One of two new Z-mount macro lenses is the MC 105mm from Nikon. There is also the more affordable Z MC 50mm f&#x2F;2.8, which is a good lens, but the MC 105mm has a better macro photography focal length and is a pro-grade lens, so it’s well worth the extra money.</p><p>A super-fast and very accurate autofocus mechanism, together with highly effective optical VR (Vibration Reduction) that can function in conjunction with the in - body stabilizers of Nikon’s full-frame Z-series cameras, provide sublime image quality for both general shooting and extreme close-ups. A multi-function OLED display, a lens-function button and control ring that can be customized, an autofocus range limiter, as well as an electronically connected focus ring that permits ultra-fine adjustments, are all features of the handling exotica camera.</p><h3 id="Nikon-AF-S-105mm-f-2-8-G-IF-ED-VR-Micro"><a href="#Nikon-AF-S-105mm-f-2-8-G-IF-ED-VR-Micro" class="headerlink" title="Nikon AF-S 105mm f&#x2F;2.8 G IF ED VR Micro"></a><strong>Nikon AF-S 105mm f&#x2F;2.8 G IF ED VR Micro</strong></h3><p>This is Nikon’s top-tier FX format macro lens, yet it also works well with DX cameras when photographing up close. It has a ring-type ultrasonic autofocus mechanism with entirely internal focusing, 3-stop VR II stabilization, and Nano Crystal coating, just like the 85mm DX lens in the group. The optical pathways of both lenses have 14 elements total, including one ED element.</p><p>The 105mm has a greater diameter because FX format lenses must produce a larger image circle to cover the larger picture sensor. At the minimum focus setting, the working distance between the front of the lens and the subject is fairly similar to the DX lens at 14.5cm. Similar to the Sigma lens, the VR system is effective for usual shooting, although it performs less well for close-up shots than the hybrid stabilizers from Tamron and Canon.</p><h2 id="5-What-are-the-price-ranges"><a href="#5-What-are-the-price-ranges" class="headerlink" title="5.

This camera supports 4k, HD, UHD, FHD, and a variety of other options. It’s larger than many of the cameras and camcorders that are listed here, but it is specially designed for this sort of work. You can also simultaneously record to two different memory cards; it has 2 audio XLRs and multiple other ports for optimum audiovisual recording.</p><p>2.   <strong>What equipment is needed for a music video?</strong></p><p>If you’re looking to put together a kit so that you can have a great music video, then you want to be sure that you have the right equipment. Here’s a quick list.</p><ul><li>The right camera(s)</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Tripods for camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li>A camera light</li><li>3 way lighting (at the very least; you can use multiple lighting setups as well)</li><li>Shotgun microphones</li><li>Boom mic setup with pole and shock mount</li><li>Audio cables and recorder(s)</li><li>XLR cables (audio cables)</li><li>Headphones (so you can adjust sound levels more accurately)</li><li>Extra batteries, memory cards, and other equipment, so your gear doesn’t die while you’re filming.</li></ul><p>You may also need other materials if you’re working in a particular environment. Sit down with your crew and work out what is essential and what you may not need in terms of your equipment.</p><p>3.   <strong>What is the best lens for shooting music videos?</strong></p><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.the-digital-picture.com/Reviews/Canon-EF-135mm-f-2.0-L-USM-Lens-Review.aspx" >Canon EF 135mm f&#x2F;2L USM Lens <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the best lenses on the market for shooting music videos. It has an UltraSonic motor, 135mm focal length, and a focus distance of 3 feet. You can also get it with a polarizer or a UV Protection Filter.</p><p>The speed and versatility of this lens allows you to get some beautiful video, and it works with most models of camera that we’ve discussed in this article.</p><p>4.   <strong>How long does it take to make a music video?</strong></p><p>It depends on exactly what it is that you are doing in the video. Most of the time, artists have some sort of idea as to what their main concept will be in the video, and who they want to work with. Otherwise, the record label will be in charge of such things. In general, this depends on the song being recorded and what sort of budget is being worked with.</p><p>On average, it takes around <strong>two weeks</strong> to get everything recorded and ready to go; it could take longer on the front end and back end when it comes to organizing and scheduling.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/new-7-top-budget-friendly-digital-camera-editing-tools/"><u>[New] 7 Top Budget-Friendly Digital Camera Editing Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/new-breaking-barriers-the-best-pc-vr-headsets-of-2023/"><u>[New] Breaking Barriers The Best PC VR Headsets of 2023</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-building-a-thriving-igtv-following-the-ultimate-guide-for-2024/"><u>[New] Building a Thriving IGTV Following The Ultimate Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-fixed-how-do-i-convert-zip-file-into-srt-file/"><u>2024 Approved [Fixed!] How Do I Convert Zip File Into Srt File?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/a-detailed-guide-on-faking-your-location-in-mozilla-firefox-on-xiaomi-14-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>A Detailed Guide on Faking Your Location in Mozilla Firefox On Xiaomi 14 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/addressing-and-overcoming-steam-game-ignition-challenges-in-windows-11/"><u>Addressing & Overcoming Steam Game Ignition Challenges in Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/from-concept-to-completion-using-magix-video-pro-x/"><u>From Concept to Completion Using Magix Video Pro X</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/haste-assessment-of-windows-documents/"><u>Haste Assessment of Windows Documents</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/immerse-in-a-world-of-efficient-notes-with-mematic/"><u>Immerse in a World of Efficient Notes with Mematic</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-downloading-samfw-frp-tool-30-for-itel-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Downloading SamFw FRP Tool 3.0 for Itel</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/most-popular-firefox-screenshots-and-recorders-for-2024/"><u>Most Popular Firefox Screenshots & Recorders for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/new-optimizing-video-output-with-compressor-in-fcpx-for-2024/"><u>New Optimizing Video Output with Compressor in FCPX for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/tips-for-addressing-sluggish-downloads-on-windows-pcs/"><u>Tips for Addressing Sluggish Downloads on Windows PCs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/updated-make-music-without-spending-a-dime-10-best-free-recording-software-for-2024/"><u>Updated Make Music Without Spending a Dime 10 Best Free Recording Software for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="A-Symphony-of-Shades-Applying-Complementary-Colors"><a href="#A-Symphony-of-Shades-Applying-Complementary-Colors" class="headerlink" title="A Symphony of Shades: Applying Complementary Colors"></a>A Symphony of Shades: Applying Complementary Colors</h2><p>So, you’ve heard about color theory but don’t know what it is or how to use it and you may also be wondering what color theory could possibly have to do with you. We are talking about the theory of all color combinations and how they can be altered or selected to better work together creating a more pleasant viewing for your audience.</p><p>If you are more selective with your colors in your videos or imagery the viewer will find this aesthetically pleasing and may be more engaged in your content. This includes anything from logo design all the way to props for your shot. When creating your videos within Filmora it is good practice to think about your composition in all aspects including color theory and with the guide hopefully you will have a better understanding of how you can influence your color palette.</p><h2 id="What-Is-Color-Theory"><a href="#What-Is-Color-Theory" class="headerlink" title="What Is Color Theory"></a>What Is Color Theory</h2><p>Color theory consists of many elements that could fill a library on its own but for this guide we will focus on two key elements. The color wheel and color harmony. By understanding the color wheel and color harmony you can hand pick which colors to add or use in your pieces to create a well-balanced viewing experience which can help in viewer engagement and enjoyment.</p><p>There are many color wheels out there and all require understanding and research into that particular color arrangement but for this guide I will be focusing on the more widely used RGB which derives from the primary colors red green and blue, If you’re thinking why red green and blue not red yellow and blue then you are observant, while RYB is taught as the three primary colors we will be using what is known as additive primary colors of light meaning the more you add of these colors the closer to white you get, the reason we will be using this combination is due to the fact RYB misses a lot of hues around the violet area and the blue-greens meaning we achieve a higher range of color to pick from. With this in mind let’s start.</p><h2 id="The-Color-Wheel"><a href="#The-Color-Wheel" class="headerlink" title="The Color Wheel"></a>The Color Wheel</h2><p>Using red, green and blue as primary colors we can mix the colors to one another to get our secondary colors giving us yellow, magenta and cyan. We can mix these to one another to create our tertiary colors which are raspberry, orange, sprig green, turquoise, ocean and violet giving us something which looks like this</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/color-wheel.jpg"                      alt="colcor wheel"                ></p><p>As you can see, we have every color available in this wheel and they are arranged in a unison with the mixed colors starting with red, green and blue and working towards each other.</p><h2 id="Color-Harmony"><a href="#Color-Harmony" class="headerlink" title="Color Harmony"></a>Color Harmony</h2><p>So now we know how the wheel is made and what it looks like. What does it do? We can use this wheel now to gather our palette. Within color theory we talk about harmonious colors that work together in a pleasant way creating less stress on the eyes to find information in your scene.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-harmony.jpg"                      alt="color harmony"                ></p><p>One such harmony is complementary colors and luckily for us this is very easy to find. You take your base color and find the opposite color on the wheel. In this example the complementary color to blue is yellow depicted with a red line.</p><p>These colors always work as they create contrast and stability.</p><p>The blue lines represent what is known as split contrasting colors and these will create balance with each other.</p><p>The corners of the black rectangle land on what is known as tetradic complement and allows you to add four colors with the understanding that they will complement each other perfectly. Lastly is the purple line which represents the analogous complementary colors, you can pick these neighboring colors with the peace of mind that they will harmonize with each other. There are many more but these four are the main ones that you will use more often than any other, by selecting colors using these four main types you can create a palette for your scenes and allow the viewer to effortlessly enjoy your content. These types work no matter where you start from on the wheel so long as you keep the distances the same.</p><h2 id="But-How-Do-I-Use-This"><a href="#But-How-Do-I-Use-This" class="headerlink" title="But How Do I Use This"></a>But How Do I Use This</h2><p>You may still be unsure as to how to implement color theory into your videos. Let’s look at some scenarios that color theory may help your creations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/apply-color-theory-video.jpg"                      alt="apply color theory video"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868499/19272" target="_top" id="1868499">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868499" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868499/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>In this scene the director decided that the backdrop should complement the top the actor is wearing, looking at our wheel we can see the complementary color would be dark purple so they started with that, to create a more dynamic scene they then used the analogous colors of that purple being pink and red and created the backdrop. This creates a harmony within the scene and makes it effortless to see all the key elements straight away.</p><p>As you can see from this example the base color for the scene is a dark blue&#x2F;purple and using the analogous color of pink they created a point of interest within the scene that doesn’t look out of place. This is a very good way to pull the viewers eyes towards something you want them to take in above all else.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/movie-cover-with-color-theory.jpg"                      alt="movie cover with color theory"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1166360/14483" target="_top" id="1166360">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1166360" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://electronicx.pxf.io/i/5597632/1166360/14483"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>As you can see from all the movie covers above, they all use complementary colors from the blues to the war yellows and oranges, this creates high contrast and balance and is something done within the movie industry in every scene.

Inexperienced photographers have a tendency to photograph things in their immediate surroundings, but in time they develop their unique ways of finding unusual angles from which they photograph scenes.</p><p> In this article, we are going to introduce you to different types of shots that can help you find a perfect angle for each and every of your iPhone photos.</p><h2 id="How-to-Find-Perfect-Angles-for-Your-iPhone-Photos"><a href="#How-to-Find-Perfect-Angles-for-Your-iPhone-Photos" class="headerlink" title="How to Find Perfect Angles for Your iPhone Photos"></a>How to Find Perfect Angles for Your iPhone Photos</h2><p> Learning how to use different shot angles will enable you to take better photos with your iPhone. Let’s have a look at some of the commonly used camera angles in photography as well as some tips that will enable you to improve your iPhone photography skills.</p><h4 id="1-Close-Ups"><a href="#1-Close-Ups" class="headerlink" title="1.  Close Ups"></a>1.  Close Ups</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/close-up-angle.jpg"                      alt="close-up-angle."                ></p><p> Image resource: Digital Care Solutions</p><p> A close up is the type of shot that depicts only a small fraction of a scene or a detail. These shots are frequently used for portraits that show only a portion of a human face or some interesting detail. Furthermore, product photography relies heavily on close-ups because it often depicts fruit, and all sorts of tiny objects, that would be too small to photograph in a wide-angle shot.</p><p> There are two different ways in which you can create a close-up. iPhone cameras allow you to zoom in on the subject of your photo, but if the object is too far away, using the zoom may blur and ruin the photo completely. The alternative is to get as close as possible to the object you want to take the picture of, because you won’t have to rely too much on the zoom features and you’ll be able to separate the subject of the photo from its background.</p><h4 id="2-Low-Angle-Shots"><a href="#2-Low-Angle-Shots" class="headerlink" title="2.  Low-Angle Shots"></a>2.  Low-Angle Shots</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/low-angle-shot-photography.jpg"                      alt="low-angle-shot-photography"                ></p><p> Image resource: google</p><p> Even though we often don’t think about it, our field of vision strongly influences the way we think about pictures. The most common way to take a photo is to place the camera at the height of your eye level, and for that reason, any camera position that is located below this point is considered a low-angle shot.</p><p> This type of shot is frequently used in nearly all niches of photography, but it is best suited for portraits and street or architecture photography. Low angle shot makes figures and objects in your photos look bigger than they really are, which often has a strong impression on the viewer.</p><h4 id="3-Straight-Up-Take-Pictures-of-things-above-you"><a href="#3-Straight-Up-Take-Pictures-of-things-above-you" class="headerlink" title="3.  Straight Up - Take Pictures of things above you"></a>3.  Straight Up - Take Pictures of things above you</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/straight-shots-iphone.jpg"                      alt="straight-shots-iphone"                ></p><p> Image resource: Digital Photography Review</p><p> Raising your head up from time to time to see what is directly above you, may not be such a bad idea for any aspiring iPhone photographer because it will enable you to snap a photo from a unique perspective. Forests, skyscrapers or starry skies are all perfect scenery for straight up shots, however, if the scene doesn’t have enough light try to avoid holding your iPhone in your hand, because you might end up with a blurry picture.</p><p> Straight up shots require a lot of attention to picture composition since they provide numerous ways to use basic and advanced image composition techniques. The greatest downside of straight up shots is that they are largely dependent on the immediate surroundings of a photographer.</p><h4 id="4-Shoot-from-the-height-of-your-hip"><a href="#4-Shoot-from-the-height-of-your-hip" class="headerlink" title="4.  Shoot from the height of your hip"></a>4.  Shoot from the height of your hip</h4><p> Holding your iPhone at the height of your hip is another simple and effective way to find an angle that offers a unique perspective of the scene. Shooting from the hip is especially useful if you want to use your iPhone for Street photography because it makes the act of taking a photo much less obvious. Spontaneity is probably the most important aspect of street photography, and if nobody realizes you are taking pictures, the photos will look more candid.</p><p> Framing might a bit more complicated since you can’t really look at your display while you are taking a picture but if you use this type of a shot frequently your ability to create perfectly framed photos without even looking will improve significantly.</p><h4 id="5-Bird’s-Eye-View"><a href="#5-Bird’s-Eye-View" class="headerlink" title="5.  Bird’s Eye View"></a>5.  Bird’s Eye View</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bird-eye-view-shots.jpg"                      alt="bird-eye-view-shots"                ></p><p> Image resource: Google</p><p> Looking down on a beautiful view impresses everyone, but putting yourself in a position to watch the world from a top of a mountain or even a building requires a certain level of preparation. However, a bird’s eye view angle can be captured on any location, and you just need to place yourself above the subject of your photo. This type of shot can be used for portraits, areal shots, and even breathtaking landscapes, but all objects depicted in bird’s eye view photos will appear smaller than they actually are.</p><p> Stairwells or even chairs can be used to take a high vantage point, but you must also make sure that your iPhone is perfectly stable and avoid camera shakes at any cost.</p><h4 id="6-Use-a-Frame-Within-a-Frame"><a href="#6-Use-a-Frame-Within-a-Frame" class="headerlink" title="6.  Use a Frame Within a Frame"></a>6.  Use a Frame Within a Frame</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-frame-photography.jpg"                      alt="use-frame-photography"                ></p><p> Image resource: Chris Utano Photography</p><p> All photos have a rectangular shape, and depicting the same shape within a photo creates instant dynamics between the shape you captured in a photo and its literal shape. A frame can be literally anything from a window in your room to a crack in the wall or even an old photo frame, and each item you use as a frame will give the photo a special atmosphere.</p><p> Even though frames are an incredibly fun way to create photos, they obstruct the view of the spectator which is why figuring out how to incorporate a frame into the composition of your shot may take some patience and practice.</p><h4 id="7-Use-Transparent-Objects-as-Lens-Filters"><a href="#7-Use-Transparent-Objects-as-Lens-Filters" class="headerlink" title="7.  Use Transparent Objects as Lens Filters"></a>7.  Use Transparent Objects as Lens Filters</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shoot-trought-another-subject.jpg"                      alt="shoot-trought-another-subject"                ></p><p> Image resource: Digital Photo Secrets</p><p> You don’t have to know anything about camera lens filters in order to use them. Your sunglasses, glasses of water or any other transparent or reflecting surface can be used as a filter through which you take pictures.</p><p> If you take a photo through a glass of water you’ll be able to create a distorted image of the view behind the glass. Taking photos through transparent objects can be a lot of fun, but it is often more complicated than it seems. Controlling aperture, exposure or focus manually from your iPhone may help you get better results because you’ll be able to decide where the focal point of the photo will be or fine-tune the amount of light your iPhone camera can pick up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-chart-success-the-top-online-stock-portals/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Chart Success The Top Online Stock Portals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/new-achieving-professional-grade-motion-blur-using-photoshop-tools/"><u>[New] Achieving Professional-Grade Motion Blur Using Photoshop Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/new-bold-creation-mastering-timelapses-and-animations-with-movie-maker/"><u>[New] Bold Creation Mastering Timelapses & Animations with Movie Maker</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-discover-the-power-of-5-editors-beyond-youtubes-boundaries/"><u>[New] In 2024, Discover the Power of 5 Editors Beyond Youtube's Boundaries</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/op-15-webcams-for-quality-youtube-live-streams/"><u>[New] Top 15 Webcams for Quality YouTube Live Streams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-speedy-switching-spree-from-srt-to-txt-files-done-quickly/"><u>[Updated] Speedy Switching Spree From SRT to TXT Files Done Quickly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/4-solution-to-get-rid-of-pokemon-fail-to-detect-location-on-apple-iphone-15-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>4 solution to get rid of pokemon fail to detect location On Apple iPhone 15 Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/from-everyday-use-to-extraordinary-virtual-adventures-smartphone-vr-conversion-guide/"><u>From Everyday Use to Extraordinary Virtual Adventures Smartphone-VR Conversion Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-compreranly-curated-list-best-free-srt-translators-online/"><u>In 2024, A Compreranly Curated List Best Free SRT Translators Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/in-2024-b-footage-techniques-for-creating-engaging-video-content/"><u>In 2024, B-Footage Techniques for Creating Engaging Video Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-complete-tutorial-to-use-gps-joystick-to-fake-gps-location-on-sony-xperia-10-v-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Complete Tutorial to Use GPS Joystick to Fake GPS Location On Sony Xperia 10 V | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-best-android-unlock-software-for-realme-gt-5-device-top-5-picks-to-remove-android-locks-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, The Best Android Unlock Software For Realme GT 5 Device Top 5 Picks to Remove Android Locks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-what-to-do-if-your-iphone-13-pro-has-bad-esn-or-blacklisted-imei-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, What to do if your iPhone 13 Pro has bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/journey-to-freedom-with-free-movie-player-os-x-and-windows/"><u>Journey to Freedom with FREE MOVIE PLAYER (OS X & Windows)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/the-pros-handbook-to-perfecting-your-gopro-studio-project/"><u>The Pro's Handbook to Perfecting Your GoPro Studio Project</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135315/14409" target="_top" id="2135315">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2135315" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135315/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>
