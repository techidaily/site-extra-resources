In addition, the range of drawing and painting tools varies, which can limit your options while performing complex drawing or painting operations.</p><p>That’s why in this article we are going to take you through the top ten drawing apps for iPadOS you can use just for fun or for professional purposes.</p><h2 id="Ten-Best-Drawing-Apps-for-iPad-and-iPad-Pro"><a href="#Ten-Best-Drawing-Apps-for-iPad-and-iPad-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Ten Best Drawing Apps for iPad and iPad Pro"></a>Ten Best Drawing Apps for iPad and iPad Pro</h2><p>Although all of the drawing apps we featured in this article are capable of great performances, they are not arranged in a particular order. However, we strived to include apps that are suitable for users at different experience levels. Here’s what the apps we selected have to offer.</p><h3 id="1-Affinity-Designer"><a href="#1-Affinity-Designer" class="headerlink" title="1. Affinity Designer"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/affinity-designer-2-for-ipad/id1616833418" >Affinity Designer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> $19.99</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS 11 or later, compatible with iPad</p><p><strong>User Rating:</strong> 4.0</p><p>Much like its desktop version, Affinity Designer for iPad is equipped with all tools professional designers and digital artists need to create stunning imagery. The app is also compatible with the Apple Pencil and it offers touch controls, although you can only use it on iPad Pro, iPad Air 2, or 3 and versions of iPad that are produced from 2017 onwards.</p><p>Artists who work with vectors often are going to enjoy the Affinity Designer’s vector tools that enable them to apply live effects, perform the non-destructive Boolean operation or provide stabilization for brushes and pencils while they are drawing curved lines. What’s more switching between vector and raster workspaces requires a single tap, so that you can combine the two with ease. The app’s typography tools are equally impressive as you can choose the style of a single character or an entire paragraph.</p><h3 id="2-Inspire-Pro"><a href="#2-Inspire-Pro" class="headerlink" title="2. Inspire Pro"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/inspire-pro/id355460798" >Inspire Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> $9.99</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Requires iOS 13.4 or later, compatible with iPad</p><p><strong>User Rating:</strong> 4.4</p><p>Inspire Pro features Sorcery proprietary painting engine that is capable of rendering 64-bit colors for each brushstroke you make. Moreover, the app is designed to bring a unique painting, sketching, and drawing experience to iPad users.</p><p>There are more than 150 brushes to choose from including oil paints, graphite pencils, markers, or wax crayons among others. In addition, each brush can be used in Wet Brush, Dry Brush, and Eraser mode, while every brush can be adjusted with more than 20 settings. Inspire Pro also provides support for Apple Pencil and it registers the pressure, orientation, tilt angle, and double- taps promptly. In addition, the app has more than a thousand undo and redo levels which enables you to correct all mistakes effortlessly.</p><h3 id="3-Procreate"><a href="#3-Procreate" class="headerlink" title="3. Procreate"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/procreate/id425073498" >Procreate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> $9.99, offers in-app purchases</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Requires iOS 13.2 or later, compatible with iPad</p><p><strong>User Rating:</strong> 4.5</p><p>Designed to meet the expectations of creative industry professionals, Procreate is among the best drawing apps for iPads ever created. A selection of hundreds of handmade brushes, Ultra High Definition canvases with resolutions that go up to 16K by 4K on iPad Pros or a 64-bit printing engine are only a few reasons why Procreate is highly praised by creative professionals.</p><p>To make things even better all brushes are organized in different sets, and there are over a hundred settings available for each brush. In addition, the app doesn’t limit the number of layers you can add to a canvas and it offers 25 layer blend modes that enable you to composite images with ease. Procreate lets you include vector texts in your illustrations, while you can also make a time-lapse replay of your creative process and export it as a 4K video.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettiit.sjv.io/c/5597632/2114267/17093" target="_top" id="2114267">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17093-2114267" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettiit.sjv.io/i/5597632/2114267/17093"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Autodesk-SkecthBook"><a href="#4-Autodesk-SkecthBook" class="headerlink" title="4.

Moreover, Autodesk SketchBook lets you set a vanishing point with a single tap, while you can use the Perspective Guides to organize the canvas before you start drawing. The app is compatible with the second generation of Apple Pencil which means that it supports the double-tap functionality, while the Scan Sketch feature is also supported on the latest versions of iPads.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135415/19272" target="_top" id="2135415">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135415" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135415/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Concepts"><a href="#5-Concepts" class="headerlink" title="5.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="A-Visual-Editor’-Writes-Guide-to-Leveraging-LUTs-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#A-Visual-Editor’-Writes-Guide-to-Leveraging-LUTs-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="A Visual Editor’ Writes Guide to Leveraging LUTs in Adobe Premiere Pro"></a>A Visual Editor’ Writes Guide to Leveraging LUTs in Adobe Premiere Pro</h2><p>Whether you’re working on a personal project or a business campaign, the procedure is very much the same:</p><p>you grab the camera, follow your idea, and acquire your pictures, then transfer the movie to your computer and start editing. In this protracted creative process, color grading is typically the final and possibly at least one of the most crucial processes. We all hoped there’s a way to speed up this procedure, and fortunately there is! Let’s start!</p><h2 id="1-How-to-install-LUTs-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#1-How-to-install-LUTs-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="1. How to install LUTs in Premiere Pro"></a>1. How to install LUTs in Premiere Pro</h2><p>LUTs can be applied in Premiere Pro in two different ways. Utilizing LUTs through the Creative tab of the Lumetri Color Panel is the simplest method. However, it does not make the LUTs a permanent part of the collection.</p><p>Step1Download your LUTs bundle, then unzip it to get the LUTs out. Find and copy the.Cube format files. They are the 3D LUTs file format.</p><p>Step2Locate the Lumetri LUTs folder in your Premiere Pro installation directory (for example, C: Program Files&#x2F;AdobePremiere Pro CC&#x2F;LumetriLUTSCreative).</p><p>Step3Paste all of your fresh LUTs in this folder at this time. Your new LUTs will now show up in the Lumetri Color Panel when you launch Premiere Pro (or restart the software if it was already open). Innovative &gt;&gt; Looks</p><h2 id="2-How-to-add-LUTs-to-your-footage"><a href="#2-How-to-add-LUTs-to-your-footage" class="headerlink" title="2. How to add LUTs to your footage"></a>2. How to add LUTs to your footage</h2><p>Step1Choose the Color Workspace at the top after your clip is in the timeline and prepared for grading.</p><p>Step2Click OK after selecting New Item &gt; Adjustment Layer in the Project window’s bottom left corner. The adjustment layer will show up in your project window in step three. It can then be dropped on the track above your video by clicking and dragging it onto the timeline. To make sure it covers the entire piece of film, click, and drag.</p><p>Step3The first Basic Correction option in the right-hand panel of Lumetri Color is Input LUT. Choose this, click Browse, and then go to the location where your LUTs are stored.</p><p>Step4Double-click the LUT you wish to use once you’ve located it, and it will be applied immediately.A tiny tip I like to use occasionally is to find the Effect Controls panel on the left side, then click the drop-down arrow next to Opacity, and make adjustments if you input your LUT and feel that it’s too intense.</p><h2 id="3-Why-use-LUTs-in-your-project"><a href="#3-Why-use-LUTs-in-your-project" class="headerlink" title="3. Why use LUTs in your project?"></a>3. Why use LUTs in your project?</h2><p>When there is no time limit or restriction on when to submit the result file, it is fun to edit your own clips because you have complete creative control over the process. Because of this, Color Grading is a rather unimportant aspect to worry about. After making a few adjustments to the Exposure and Contrast settings, you should be good to go.</p><p>Your finished product, when paired with the appropriate color scheme, has the power to create the atmosphere you want for the video, but managing that aspect of the project can be challenging at times.</p><p>Because of this, some designers employ look-up tables (LUTs) that they have created themselves or something that is currently available on the internet and is ready to install and use.</p><p>When it comes to working on a project for a customer that has a stringent deadline to fulfill, poor color grading could result in a negative impression of your work. This is the case even if everything from the sound effects to the video effects is done to a high standard and is done well.</p><h2 id="4-Can-you-adjust-the-strength-of-the-LUT"><a href="#4-Can-you-adjust-the-strength-of-the-LUT" class="headerlink" title="4. Can you adjust the strength of the LUT?"></a>4. Can you adjust the strength of the LUT?</h2><p>There are no such modifications that can be made in a certain LUT or Look, and there is no reason to adjust them because there is no need to. However, you may change its strength, which is essentially the same thing as the opacity of the LUT that was applied, and there are still choices to color grade the entire movie after the LUT has been applied.</p><p>The entire color panel in Premiere Pro is packed with all of the color grading tools that are required to adjust your film in the appropriate way. Investigating them can provide you with some understanding of how they function. You can get a sense of how these LUTs function by using the pre-installed LUTs that are accessible in Premiere Pro, which you can use at first to get a feel for the LUTs before moving on to using paid or free Color Grading profiles.</p><p>The end outcome does not vary by a substantial amount, but how it looks can change depending on the LUT you use. In the event that something seems to be lacking, you can always modify the color grading.</p><h2 id="5-Export-LUTs"><a href="#5-Export-LUTs" class="headerlink" title="5. Export LUTs"></a>5. Export LUTs</h2><p>An awesome feature of Premiere Pro enables you store and reuse your color modifications in multiple projects or programs. You have the option of exporting color grading information as either a.look file or a .cube LUT file, which may then be used in Adobe Premiere Pro or another application. Here’s how you export them:</p><p>Click on the pop-up menu labeled “Lumetri Color,” then select one of the following options:</p><p>Step1”.look” exports color adjustments as a Lumetri file. Exporting “.look” File containing a Look preset, saved in the.look format.</p><p>Step2Export “.cube” This function exports lookup tables in the.cube format so that they can be imported into other color grading programs.</p><p>Step3Store Preset: You can personalize the settings for each color effect, then save the resulting combinations as presets. Within the Save Preset dialog box, give your preset the name you want it to have. If desired, enter a description.

Is the lighting correct? Is the focus autofocus or manual? Is the background distracting from the subject? But there’s another thing you should be thinking about: camera shake. If you’ve ever looked at pictures online and thought they’re blurred - that’s probably because of camera shake. This isn’t always easy to get rid of post-production if you’ve filmed on a DSLR camera, so it’s better to get it right in camera. A few different things cause a camera shake, so here we’ll take a look at what causes this and how you can stop it from happening when taking your next photograph.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/camera-shake-1.jpg"                      alt="camera shake effect"                ></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">The Definition of Camera Shake</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Is Camera Shake A Bad Thing?</a></p><h2 id="The-Definition-of-Camera-Shake"><a href="#The-Definition-of-Camera-Shake" class="headerlink" title="The Definition of Camera Shake"></a>The Definition of Camera Shake</h2><p>Camera shake is the camera’s movement during the exposure of a photograph. This can be caused by either a badly mounted camera or because the shutter speed was too slow for the lens’s focal length. Camera shake is most noticeable when you shoot at telephoto focal lengths and at high magnifications (zoomed in) with a long exposure time.</p><h3 id="In-Pictures"><a href="#In-Pictures" class="headerlink" title="In Pictures"></a>In Pictures</h3><p>Anyone who takes pictures seriously will eventually face the problem of camera shake. This happens when the camera shakes during exposure due to the photographer pushing the shutter button or a shaky hand. This can result in blurry photos, but there are several ways to avoid it in most situations. Camera shake is one of the most common problems photographers and videographers face and is one of the easiest to fix.</p><h3 id="In-Videos"><a href="#In-Videos" class="headerlink" title="In Videos"></a>In Videos</h3><p>Videos are made up of individual frames, each capturing one moment in time. When your video contains a scene that moves from left to right, the frames that make up that scene move from left to right as well. If there’s any movement in the frame except for horizontal movements, such as vertical movement caused by camera shake, you’ll see it in every frame of your video.</p><h2 id="Is-Camera-Shake-A-Bad-Thing"><a href="#Is-Camera-Shake-A-Bad-Thing" class="headerlink" title="Is Camera Shake A Bad Thing?"></a>Is Camera Shake A Bad Thing?</h2><p>So, is camera shake a bad thing? Yes, most of the time, but there are times when you can actually use it to your advantage. For example, in a long exposure shot, you may want to introduce some camera shake on purpose to blur moving objects and create a creative effect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/camera-shake-2.jpg"                      alt="is camera shake a bad thing"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137207/26400" target="_top" id="2137207">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137207" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137207/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Another example where a camera shake can work in your favour is handheld macro photography. When shooting handheld macro shots, the motion of your hands can help keep the lens aligned with an object in front of you—if you move too slowly, the lens might lose alignment with what you’re shooting.</p><p>So if you find yourself facing a situation where you don’t have a tripod or monopod handy, and you need steady shots, try using different techniques like bracing your body against solid objects or using burst mode to capture multiple images and choosing the sharpest one from the bunch.</p><h3 id="In-Pictures-1"><a href="#In-Pictures-1" class="headerlink" title="In Pictures"></a>In Pictures</h3><p>A camera shake is a big problem for most photographers. It’s the enemy of sharp images, and when you’re shooting with a telephoto lens, even the smallest amount of camera shake can cause blurry images.</p><p>A camera shake is generally a bad thing when you’re shooting still photography. It can cause your images to be blurry (and therefore unusable), and the more you zoom in, the more pronounced that effect is.</p><p>If you’re shooting with a tripod, you’ll know if you have a camera shake if the image looks blurry. If it does, don’t worry — there are ways to fix it in post-processing. But it’s better to not have to do that in the first place!</p><p>There are various ways in which the camera can shake, but the important thing is that this is generally undesirable. If you’re into abstract expressionism or “happy accidents”, you may disagree with the latter statement, and that’s your prerogative!</p><p>It is usually preferable for the rest of us to have photos that aren’t blurry due to camera shake. When we say “blurry,” we’re not referring to the depth of field or out-of-focus shots. Those are two entirely different things.</p><h3 id="In-Videos-1"><a href="#In-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="In Videos"></a>In Videos</h3><p>Many people already know about camera shake when it comes to photography. If you’re taking a picture and your shutter speed is too slow, or you don’t have a tripod handy, or your hands aren’t steady enough, that can cause blur in your pictures. The same thing can happen when shooting a video. There are many times when camera shake is used as an artistic effect in videos.</p><p>Like many filmmaking techniques, you’re going to want to shoot plenty of footage and then pick the perfect clips later. However, when it comes to camera shake, you’re better off overdoing it with your takes than underdoing it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/camera-shake-3.jpg"                      alt="is camera shake a bad thing in video"                ></p><p>A great way to add energy and intensity to your shots is camera movement. Whether you are walking with your camera or running, a bit of shake in your footage can give a sense of excitement and urgency to your shots.</p><p>However, when shooting video, camera shake is often used as an artistic effect. A lot of Hollywood blockbusters will add blurriness and shake for dramatic effect. Some action sequences have been shot entirely on handheld cameras for this reason. But to pull off this technique successfully, you need to have extremely steady hands. If you don’t have the steadiest hands, you can always use a good tripod instead.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Eliminating <strong>camera shake</strong> and gaining better control over it are lessons that almost every photographer learns early on. Yet there is still a large amount of misunderstanding about how it works. The vast majority of people don’t truly understand what causes the camera to shake or how they can control it within their shooting style to get the sharpest possible images. Whether you are a beginning or advanced amateur photographer or videographer, knowing how to exert pressure when handling your camera gear properly is key to obtaining images that show fewer signs of blur from camera shake.</p><p>As we’ve seen, there are things you can do to ensure that your photos and videos are as steady as possible. Going into any shoot with an awareness of camera shake will help you avoid accidents, but the reality is that these accidents do happen. Even if you have an extremely steady hand, your camera may not be capable of capturing the blur-free photos or videos that you’re looking for.</p><p>That’s why awareness can go a long way towards helping you catch potential problems and solve them before they become actual problems. Of course, once you notice a lack of stability in your photos, it can be easier said than done to address the issue. There are various tools out there to help smooth out shaky footage after it has been captured, but getting that footage off your camera in one piece will be the first step in being able to use those tools effectively.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>When taking photographs or filming videos, there are a lot of elements to worry about.

Is the lighting correct? Is the focus autofocus or manual? Is the background distracting from the subject? But there’s another thing you should be thinking about: camera shake. If you’ve ever looked at pictures online and thought they’re blurred - that’s probably because of camera shake. This isn’t always easy to get rid of post-production if you’ve filmed on a DSLR camera, so it’s better to get it right in camera. A few different things cause a camera shake, so here we’ll take a look at what causes this and how you can stop it from happening when taking your next photograph.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/camera-shake-1.jpg"                      alt="camera shake effect"                ></p><h4 id="In-this-article-2"><a href="#In-this-article-2" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">The Definition of Camera Shake</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Is Camera Shake A Bad Thing?</a></p><h2 id="The-Definition-of-Camera-Shake-2"><a href="#The-Definition-of-Camera-Shake-2" class="headerlink" title="The Definition of Camera Shake"></a>The Definition of Camera Shake</h2><p>Camera shake is the camera’s movement during the exposure of a photograph. This can be caused by either a badly mounted camera or because the shutter speed was too slow for the lens’s focal length. Camera shake is most noticeable when you shoot at telephoto focal lengths and at high magnifications (zoomed in) with a long exposure time.</p><h3 id="In-Pictures-4"><a href="#In-Pictures-4" class="headerlink" title="In Pictures"></a>In Pictures</h3><p>Anyone who takes pictures seriously will eventually face the problem of camera shake. This happens when the camera shakes during exposure due to the photographer pushing the shutter button or a shaky hand. This can result in blurry photos, but there are several ways to avoid it in most situations. Camera shake is one of the most common problems photographers and videographers face and is one of the easiest to fix.</p><h3 id="In-Videos-4"><a href="#In-Videos-4" class="headerlink" title="In Videos"></a>In Videos</h3><p>Videos are made up of individual frames, each capturing one moment in time. When your video contains a scene that moves from left to right, the frames that make up that scene move from left to right as well. If there’s any movement in the frame except for horizontal movements, such as vertical movement caused by camera shake, you’ll see it in every frame of your video.</p><h2 id="Is-Camera-Shake-A-Bad-Thing-2"><a href="#Is-Camera-Shake-A-Bad-Thing-2" class="headerlink" title="Is Camera Shake A Bad Thing?"></a>Is Camera Shake A Bad Thing?</h2><p>So, is camera shake a bad thing? Yes, most of the time, but there are times when you can actually use it to your advantage. For example, in a long exposure shot, you may want to introduce some camera shake on purpose to blur moving objects and create a creative effect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/camera-shake-2.jpg"                      alt="is camera shake a bad thing"                ></p><p>Another example where a camera shake can work in your favour is handheld macro photography. When shooting handheld macro shots, the motion of your hands can help keep the lens aligned with an object in front of you—if you move too slowly, the lens might lose alignment with what you’re shooting.</p><p>So if you find yourself facing a situation where you don’t have a tripod or monopod handy, and you need steady shots, try using different techniques like bracing your body against solid objects or using burst mode to capture multiple images and choosing the sharpest one from the bunch.</p><h3 id="In-Pictures-5"><a href="#In-Pictures-5" class="headerlink" title="In Pictures"></a>In Pictures</h3><p>A camera shake is a big problem for most photographers. It’s the enemy of sharp images, and when you’re shooting with a telephoto lens, even the smallest amount of camera shake can cause blurry images.</p><p>A camera shake is generally a bad thing when you’re shooting still photography. It can cause your images to be blurry (and therefore unusable), and the more you zoom in, the more pronounced that effect is.</p><p>If you’re shooting with a tripod, you’ll know if you have a camera shake if the image looks blurry. If it does, don’t worry — there are ways to fix it in post-processing. But it’s better to not have to do that in the first place!</p><p>There are various ways in which the camera can shake, but the important thing is that this is generally undesirable.

First thing to get aware with when going for silhouetted photo is making sure what subject you choose. You should make certain that your subject carries a convincing and recognizable shape. The picture would also be compelling when taken against a setting sun, behind a curtain or sheet. Let us now get the tips and techniques in detail for perfect silhouette photography with your iPhone.</p><h3 id="Tips"><a href="#Tips" class="headerlink" title="Tips"></a>Tips</h3><h4 id="1-Light-Source"><a href="#1-Light-Source" class="headerlink" title="1.  Light Source"></a>1.  Light Source</h4><p> Silhouette photography can be best done when the shot is taken against the source of light. The camera sensor generally fails to interpret the shadow details unlike a human eye. And therefore shooting against the light will help in providing the best silhouette effect. It simply implies keeping the subject against the sunlight or other source of light to get an automatic silhouette and shadowy effect. The most excellent way for emphasized and perfect silhouette photography is ensuring to shoot when there is low sunlight i.e. the time of sunrise and sunset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/silouette-agiant-light.jpg"                      alt="silouette-agiant-light"                ></p><p> Image source: Digital Photo Secrets</p><h4 id="2-Low-POV"><a href="#2-Low-POV" class="headerlink" title="2.  Low POV"></a>2.  Low POV</h4><p> A yet another tip for silhouetting effect is capturing the view from a low angle. When you will get down a little lower and capture from a low angle, it will present the picture with a plain and simple background and there will be no clumsiness related to background. The photo taken from low point or by lying down on the ground will result in position changing of the subject and adding more interest to it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/silhouette-low-pov.jpg"                      alt="silhouette-low-pov"                ></p><p> Image source: Gettyimages</p><h4 id="3-Lucid-Backgrounds"><a href="#3-Lucid-Backgrounds" class="headerlink" title="3.  Lucid Backgrounds"></a>3.  Lucid Backgrounds</h4><p> Background is one of the chief things to be considered while doing any kind of photography. When you do iPhone silhouette snapping, a mess-free background is what you should take into account. Keeping sky as the background would be perfect choice and the silhouette photography will go perfect when there are clouds in the sky. The subject will acquire a really dramatic effect. Birds and trees are other suggestions for better backdrop of your picture. In short, you should always consider the background when you desire an ideal silhouetted photo. Also, low angle shoot will work here too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/silouette-photo-simple-background.jpg"                      alt="silouette-photo-simple-background"                ></p><p> Image source: Pexels</p><h4 id="4-Space-is-Essential"><a href="#4-Space-is-Essential" class="headerlink" title="4.  Space is Essential"></a>4.  Space is Essential</h4><p> A very simple thing to keep in mind while going for silhouette photo moment is leaving enough space when the scene contains several subjects. This is important since it will become difficult to recognize the subject. For example, if there is a family silhouette photo, if you won’t give space, they will be difficult to identify separately in that shadowy effect. However, when shooting stationary subjects and they are very close, ensure a little change in the shooting angle. On the other hand, if shooting moving subjects, do it only when you feel a sufficient space between them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/silhouette-photo-space.jpg"                      alt="silhouette-photo-space"                ></p><p> Image source: astro-canada.ca</p><h4 id="5-Ensuring-Accurate-Focus-Exposure"><a href="#5-Ensuring-Accurate-Focus-Exposure" class="headerlink" title="5.  Ensuring Accurate Focus &amp; Exposure"></a>5.  Ensuring Accurate Focus &amp; Exposure</h4><p> When you decide to take an iPhone silhouette photo, please note that iPhone offers a sound exposure that can help creating a pleasing silhouette. The device’s exposure is set automatically to the subject. In case of silhouette photography, it can happen that your subject is relatively large and when the exposure is automatically set to the subject, your silhouette picture can be destroyed ultimately fading the background. Therefore, in this case, you can just tap on the background place which is ideally the brightest part like cloud in the sky. This will in turn give a silhouette effect. Hence, setting focus and exposure accurately is necessary for processing exceptional silhouette photography.</p><h4 id="6-Increase-contrast"><a href="#6-Increase-contrast" class="headerlink" title="6. Increase contrast"></a>6. Increase contrast</h4><p> You can also apply post-production concept to get the remarkable silhouette effect in your snaps. This takes a little moderation in the photography after when you click it. You can use adjustments for a better silhouette effect by adding fair amount of light levels or darkness and highlight your subject. For the adjustments, increasing the contrast would be a recommended option to make the silhouette look darker and brighter. On the other hand, you can use a little amount of vignette effect at the outer range of the photo. This will bring better attention to your subject at the center and will make your silhouette photography moment perfect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/silhouette-photo-contrast.jpg"                      alt="silhouette-photo-contrast"                ></p><p> Image source: Flickr</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-youtubes-music-magic-best-free-tools-for-wav-conversion/"><u>[New] YouTube's Music Magic Best Free Tools for WAV Conversion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/updated-a-symphony-of-shades-applying-complementary-colors/"><u>[Updated] A Symphony of Shades Applying Complementary Colors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-real-time-screen-aspects-management-guide/"><u>2024 Approved Real-Time Screen Aspects Management Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/evaluating-magix-multimedia-software/"><u>Evaluating MAGIX Multimedia Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/from-observer-to-participant-tips-for-guesting-on-tiktoks-for-2024/"><u>From Observer to Participant Tips for Guesting on TikToks for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-honor-x8b-bootloader-easily-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Unlock Honor X8b Bootloader Easily</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/in-2024-dusk-to-dawn-iphone-night-photography-essentials/"><u>In 2024, Dusk to Dawn IPhone Night Photography Essentials</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/in-2024-focusing-on-the-best-our-countdown-of-camera-lenses-1-10/"><u>In 2024, Focusing on the Best Our Countdown of Camera Lenses, #1-10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-ins-and-outs-of-designing-a-standout-podcast-promo/"><u>In 2024, The Ins and Outs of Designing a Standout Podcast Promo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-windows-leading-video-chat-pros-top-8/"><u>In 2024, Windows' Leading Video Chat Pros Top 8</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/step-by-step-tutorial-understanding-and-controlling-internet-use-with-windows/"><u>Step-by-Step Tutorial: Understanding and Controlling Internet Use with Windows 지갑</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/unveiling-3d-lut-design-techniques/"><u>Unveiling 3D LUT Design Techniques</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123468/16836" target="_top" id="2123468">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2123468" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123468/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

Or, it may happen sometimes that SRT subtitles are grammatically wrong or aligned incorrectly with the video playback. Then, an effective subtitle editor could be helpful.</p><p>In this article, we will walk you through some best tools to show you how to adjust the .srt file style, speed, and placement.

Most third-party media players do showcase the SRT-based format easily. So, you can also use Preview apps or any other software to access and read the basic text documents on Mac.</p><p>However, the QuickTime player on Mac does not always support SRT in videos. You have to convert them to a format the QuickTime Player supports or utilize a third-party <strong>SRT editor Mac</strong> allows.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Programs-can-open-SRT-Files-on-Mac-and-How-to-do-it"><a href="#Part-2-What-Programs-can-open-SRT-Files-on-Mac-and-How-to-do-it" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Programs can open SRT Files on Mac, and How to do it?"></a>Part 2: What Programs can open SRT Files on Mac, and How to do it?</h2><p>Indeed, you have to install specific types of software on your Mac device if you want to **SRT edit Mac-**based videos.

New updates of the app always bring new features, but many users miss out on the minute new changes and feature add-ons that are meant to make the overall experience and usability a lot easier and more fun. So here is a jotted down list of the coolest <strong>WhatsApp Tricks</strong> that you may not know of yet.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Cool WhatsApp Text Tricks to Make You Look Edgy</a></li><li><a href="#part2">What are the Hidden Features of WhatsApp?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Edit WhatsApp Videos with Ease</a></li></ul><h2 id="Cool-WhatsApp-Text-Tricks-to-Make-You-Look-Edgy"><a href="#Cool-WhatsApp-Text-Tricks-to-Make-You-Look-Edgy" class="headerlink" title="Cool WhatsApp Text Tricks to Make You Look Edgy"></a>Cool WhatsApp Text Tricks to Make You Look Edgy</h2><p>You can do a lot of things with your WhatsApp fonts, appearance, and texts that will make your messages look oh-so-edgy! From italics, bold, strikethrough to monospace there are plenty of text formatting tricks to dress up your epic announcements, festive greetings et al. Rounding it all, here are the best WhatsApp Typing Tricks you can use right away.</p><h4 id="1-Bold"><a href="#1-Bold" class="headerlink" title="1.Bold"></a>1.Bold</h4><p>Yes, you can bold your text. Just add a star (*) symbol before and after your text. Don’t use space between the * and the letter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-bold.jpg"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Bold"                ></p><h4 id="2-Italic"><a href="#2-Italic" class="headerlink" title="2.Italic"></a>2.Italic</h4><p>Just like the bold, you can also italicize your fonts by simply inserting Underscore Symbol ( _text_ ) at the starting and end of your sentence.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-italic.jpg"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Italic"                ></p><h4 id="3-Strikethrough"><a href="#3-Strikethrough" class="headerlink" title="3.Strikethrough"></a>3.Strikethrough</h4><p>Strikethrough is largely used to intend puns in WhatsApp, but sometimes it is also a functional tool for text corrections, used at large for online tutorials, editorials, or brainstorming. For adding Strikethrough use the Tilde Symbol (~text~) at the starting and end of your text.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-strikethrough.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Strikethrough"                ></p><h4 id="4-Monospace"><a href="#4-Monospace" class="headerlink" title="4.Monospace"></a>4.Monospace</h4><p>The monospace is a font stylization now available in WhatsApp that allows you to write fixed-width content. These WhatsApp writing tricks are useful when sharing any sort of coding or technical formulas. It will help distinguish special content from regular content. To insert it, use 3 backticks (```text```) at the beginning and end of your sentence without spacing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-monospace.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Monospace"                ></p><h4 id="5-Disable-Read-Recipients"><a href="#5-Disable-Read-Recipients" class="headerlink" title="5.Disable Read Recipients"></a>5.Disable Read Recipients</h4><p>WhatsApp introduced the Blue Tick feature to notify users when their messages are not only delivered but are seen by the recipients. But it has also been the cause of fallouts between loved ones and even trouble at work for failing to respond despite a Blue Tick. Now you can control the fury with WhatsApp Text Tricks of disabling the Read Recipient feature. Go Settings &gt;&gt; Account &gt;&gt; Privacy &gt;&gt; Read Recipients. By doing this, you won’t be able to see your contact’s blue ticks as no one will be able to see yours. Unlike custom notifications, the Read Recipient feature applies to your entire contact list and cannot be used for one specific contact. The sender would see black double ticks even if you read the message.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-disable-read-recipients.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Disable Read Recipients"                ></p><h4 id="6-Pin-Prioritized-Contacts"><a href="#6-Pin-Prioritized-Contacts" class="headerlink" title="6.Pin Prioritized Contacts"></a>6.Pin Prioritized Contacts</h4><p>Many times, we have just one or a few people whose texts matter the most. So, avoid letting those important message threads from getting pushed down below by message floods. You can pin priority contacts by opening WhatsApp, then tapping and holding the chat thread of the contact without opening it. This will show a new toolbar on the green border at the top of the window. Use the first icon of a pin to freeze the chat thread in the top position.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-pin-prioritized-contacts.jpg"                      alt="Whatsapp Pin Prioritized Contacts"                ></p><p>Source: techmesto.com</p><h4 id="7-Export-Chat-Logs"><a href="#7-Export-Chat-Logs" class="headerlink" title="7.Export Chat Logs"></a>7.Export Chat Logs</h4><p>If you wish to save the chats that you exchanged with someone special, you can email the entire chat thread to yourself or someone else, you can even save it to Drive. Open the chat thread and tap on the 3 dots icon, then click &gt;&gt;More&lt;&lt; and then click on &gt;&gt;Export Chat&lt;&lt;. This will open a host of options allowing you to export your chat logs to a multitude of destinations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-export-chat-logs.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Export Chat Logs"                ></p><h4 id="8-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-for-Formatting"><a href="#8-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-for-Formatting" class="headerlink" title="8.WhatsApp Font Tricks for Formatting"></a>8.WhatsApp Font Tricks for Formatting</h4><p>Though we have already mentioned the shortcuts for bold, italics, and other text formatting features, there is another way to format your texts if you forget the shortcuts - go for the Native Settings Strip. Once you are done typing, then tap and hold the text sections you want to format, this will open all the options in a list. You can scroll it to select your formatting command.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-font-tricks-formatting.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Font Tricks Formatting"                ></p><h4 id="9-You-Can-Apply-All-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-on-One-Word-or-Sentence"><a href="#9-You-Can-Apply-All-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-on-One-Word-or-Sentence" class="headerlink" title="9.You Can Apply All WhatsApp Font Tricks on One Word or Sentence"></a>9.You Can Apply All WhatsApp Font Tricks on One Word or Sentence</h4><p>There are plenty of things you can do with one word. It can be bold, italic, monospace, and strikethrough all at the same time. Apply the native settings or shortcuts one after another and voila!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apply-all-whatsapp-font-tricks.png"                      alt="Apply All Whatsapp Font Tricks"                ></p><h4 id="10-Share-Sections-of-Messages-While-Typing"><a href="#10-Share-Sections-of-Messages-While-Typing" class="headerlink" title="10.Share Sections of Messages While Typing"></a>10.Share Sections of Messages While Typing</h4><p>While typing a WhatsApp message if you need to cross-check certain areas with someone else, and don’t want to copy the text or overwrite your clipboard, you can directly share the text without copy-pasting or taking screenshots. This WhatsApp Typing Trick is in the same native setting strip mentioned earlier, which you can access by tapping and holding the text section you want to share, which will open the formatting strip. Once it opens then click on the 3 dots, which will turn the strip into a panel, in the panel you will find what you are looking for. The coolest part is that you can share the text not only in WhatsApp but multiple other apps like Zoom, Skype, Email… even Bluetooth!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-typing-trick.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Typing Trick"                ></p><h2 id="What-are-the-Hidden-Features-of-WhatsApp"><a href="#What-are-the-Hidden-Features-of-WhatsApp" class="headerlink" title="What are the Hidden Features of WhatsApp?"></a>What are the Hidden Features of WhatsApp?</h2><p>Since most of the above-mentioned are owing to the tricks and trades of texting via WhatsApp, let us now jot down a WhatsApp hidden feature list that applies for general usability of the wonder-app. There are useful privacy settings and chat features that can make your user experience a lot more peaceful.</p><h4 id="1-Broadcast-Announcements"><a href="#1-Broadcast-Announcements" class="headerlink" title="1.Broadcast Announcements"></a>1.Broadcast Announcements</h4><p>Never be caught up creating a group for a one-time cause and see it becoming some sort of a messaging hub for the group members, leaving you to eat their all-day chatter while exiting would be too rude. Chuck the drama with Broadcast! On earlier versions of WhatsApp conveying a message to multiple contacts would either need you to share the message one by one with your contacts or create a group. While the sharing part is not a problem other than being time-consuming, the problem with the group is that all recipients can see each other, and things can get out of control. So now you have the Broadcast Feature wherein you can send a single text to multiple contacts privately and all at once. Open WhatsApp and click on the 3-dot button on the top left and you will find broadcast - every click will direct you to the next step.</p><h4 id="2-Save-More-Data"><a href="#2-Save-More-Data" class="headerlink" title="2.Save More Data"></a>2.Save More Data</h4><p>There are many ways how you can save mobile data consumed by WhatsApp. First, you can reduce the data consumption while on call, secondly, control the downloading of media when mobile data is running. You will find both the customization options under Data and Storage in your WhatsApp settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-save-more-data.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Save More Data"                ></p><p>Source: androidauthority.com</p><h4 id="3-Share-Your-Location-Without-Ado"><a href="#3-Share-Your-Location-Without-Ado" class="headerlink" title="3.Share Your Location Without Ado"></a>3.Share Your Location Without Ado</h4><p>If there is confusion with a location, where sharing addresses is not an option, for example, getting lost in an amusement park - the easiest way to direct your mates within 20 meters of your exact position is by sharing your “location” via WhatsApp. This feature is tucked in the attachment options. Just as you share contacts, images and other stuff, click on Location and it will put you in the right direction.</p><h4 id="4-Search-Old-Chats-with-Keywords"><a href="#4-Search-Old-Chats-with-Keywords" class="headerlink" title="4.Search Old Chats with Keywords"></a>4.Search Old Chats with Keywords</h4><p>As long as you have the chat history intact you can search specific words to trace an old chat within a thread. Open the message thread of the specific contact, tap on the 3 Dots button on the top left and click on “Search”. Then type a word from the particular chat, hit enter to trace it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-search-old-chat.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Search Old Chat"                ></p><h4 id="5-Restore-Your-Chat-History-and-Deleted-Chats"><a href="#5-Restore-Your-Chat-History-and-Deleted-Chats" class="headerlink" title="5.Restore Your Chat History, and Deleted Chats"></a>5.Restore Your Chat History, and Deleted Chats</h4><p>Sometimes you can restore deleted chat history if you have switched sims or mistakenly deleted a special conversation thread. Doesn’t take too much, just uninstall and reinstall your app. On opening it, you will get the prompt to restore your chats and media. The restoration process takes about a minute depending on internet speed. Then tap NEXT when the prompt appears. Remember this trick only works on messages that are run under backup when you are using a new phone. WhatsApp runs a backup every day at 2 am.</p><h4 id="6-Snooze-WhatsApp"><a href="#6-Snooze-WhatsApp" class="headerlink" title="6.Snooze WhatsApp"></a>6.Snooze WhatsApp</h4><p>Sometimes you just need to hush your WhatsApp for just a while. Perhaps you have to lend your phone to someone but don’t want them bumping into any of your private incoming messages. While other social media allow “logging off”, WhatsApp is always there in your face! Though high-fidelity phones allow fingerprint and face locking, not everyone owns a compatible device right now. Yet you don’t have to delete the app or go Aeroplane Mode, just force stop it. Though it is not an inbuilt WhatsApp feature, you can control the gamut by going to Settings&gt;&gt; Apps and Notifications &gt;&gt; WhatsApp &gt;&gt; Disable. Then in the same section go to Data Settings and disable Background Data. If you do this, your messages will come but you won’t’ get them until you open the app, meanwhile, keep receiving calls and all use your phone full-fledged.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-hidden-feature-snooze-whatsapp.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Hidden Feature Snooze Whatsapp"                ></p><h4 id="7-Automatically-Delete-Messages-After-7-Days"><a href="#7-Automatically-Delete-Messages-After-7-Days" class="headerlink" title="7.Automatically Delete Messages After 7 Days"></a>7.Automatically Delete Messages After 7 Days</h4><p>Not every message thread is important, and many people have the habit of deleting messages just to feel organized. WhatsApp brings some zero-effort minimalism for you with this new feature available for Android users. Update your app and visit the contact’s page in WhatsApp and you will be able to see the “Disappearing Messages” option. If you enable this, your chats with the particular contact will be deleted automatically on their own.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-auto-delete-messages.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Auto Delete Messages"                ></p><h4 id="8-Mute-Stories-that-You-Don’t-Want-to-See"><a href="#8-Mute-Stories-that-You-Don’t-Want-to-See" class="headerlink" title="8.Mute Stories that You Don’t Want to See"></a>8.Mute Stories that You Don’t Want to See</h4><p>If it is annoying to open a loved one’s story and then automatically sliding into a story you did not want to open, you can MUTE the people whose stories you are not interested to see. Go to Story and tap and hold the unwanted contact to open the Mute option. Even though there is no option that you can stop the automatic carousel to the next contact’s stories altogether, you can always go by the rule of the thumb - place your thumb on the screen and the carousel won’t move.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mute-whatsapp-stories.jpg"                      alt="Mute Whatsapp Stories"                ></p><h4 id="9-Reply-Privately-to-Recipients-in-a-WhatsApp-Group"><a href="#9-Reply-Privately-to-Recipients-in-a-WhatsApp-Group" class="headerlink" title="9.Reply Privately to Recipients in a WhatsApp Group"></a>9.Reply Privately to Recipients in a WhatsApp Group</h4><p>This is as simple as it sounds. Tap and hold to select a message in a group and then open the 3-dot button at the top right to access the feature.</p><h4 id="10-Customize-Notifications-for-Specific-Contacts"><a href="#10-Customize-Notifications-for-Specific-Contacts" class="headerlink" title="10.Customize Notifications for Specific Contacts"></a>10.Customize Notifications for Specific Contacts</h4><p>Manage how you are notified of messages from specific contacts and groups. Go to the main page of the contact or group you wish to customize, and there you will find Custom Notifications. Activate the mode to open a wide range of options - notification tones, pop up, preview, etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-hidden-feature-custom-notification.jpg"                      alt="Whatsapp Hidden Feature Custom Notification"                ></p><p>Source: beebom.com</p><h2 id="Edit-WhatsApp-Videos-with-Ease"><a href="#Edit-WhatsApp-Videos-with-Ease" class="headerlink" title="Edit WhatsApp Videos with Ease"></a>Edit WhatsApp Videos with Ease</h2><p>Some of the best WhatsApp video editing tricks are coming up, wherein you can add doodles, text, and crop an image. Moreover, you also check in some external video editing tools that are quite handy to integrate with WhatsApp.</p><h4 id="1-Download-Edit-WhatsApp-Video-from-A-Contact’s-Status"><a href="#1-Download-Edit-WhatsApp-Video-from-A-Contact’s-Status" class="headerlink" title="1.Download &amp; Edit WhatsApp Video from A Contact’s Status"></a>1.Download &amp; Edit WhatsApp Video from A Contact’s Status</h4><p>There are no download options for photos and videos for WhatsApp Statuses, yet you can have it on your PC, iPhone, and Android device and surprise a loved one by editing the videos they did not send you personally. To do this, you can go to File Manager &gt;&gt; Settings &gt;&gt; Turn on Show Hidden Files; after doing this go back to Internal Storage &gt;&gt; WhatsApp &gt;&gt; Media &gt;&gt; Statuses. Once you have the Video, you can import it to Filmora and use a gamut of video editing tools to create the magic!</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><h4 id="2-Record-Video-Calls-from-PC-and-Improve-Its-Quality"><a href="#2-Record-Video-Calls-from-PC-and-Improve-Its-Quality" class="headerlink" title="2.Record Video Calls from PC and Improve Its Quality"></a>2.Record Video Calls from PC and Improve Its Quality</h4><p>For this WhatsApp Video Editing Trick, you would need to have a third-party screen recorder tool, like Wondershare Filmora on your PCs, and the iPhone 11 has one in-built software for screen recording. Either way, if you can record the WhatsApp Call with sound and all, you can further import the file into Wondershare Filmora and use high-tech editorial tools like Noise Reduction, 4K Resolution and snip any unnecessary portions in the clip.</p><h4 id="3-Snip-Out-a-GIF-from-a-Video"><a href="#3-Snip-Out-a-GIF-from-a-Video" class="headerlink" title="3.Snip Out a GIF from a Video"></a>3.Snip Out a GIF from a Video</h4><p>You can create an instant GIF out of the video file within WhatsApp. Do this, let the video download, and then freshly share it from Attach &gt;&gt; Gallery &gt;&gt; Videos. Before sending, the video editing panel would open, there, you can see the GIF option at the top right. It will shorten your video to 6 seconds, adjust the cursor to the portion you wish to use.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123509/26400" target="_top" id="2123509">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123509" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123509/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>When it comes to WhatsApp Tricks and Trades, you always have to look forward to every update.

You will go to “open with” and then choose the Photos app. When it is open in the application, you can click on “Edit &amp; Create” and then go to “Add slo-mo”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slow-motion-photos-app.jpg"                      alt="slow motion video microsoft photos"                ></p><p>If you do not see the option anywhere on your Photos app, there is a chance you are running an outdated version of Windows 10 on your computer. All you need to do is navigate to Windows Update through your system menu. When all the updates install, you will have the latest Photos app with this feature.</p><h2 id="Part-2：Customizing-the-Slow-Motion-Effect"><a href="#Part-2：Customizing-the-Slow-Motion-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Part 2：Customizing the Slow Motion Effect"></a>Part 2：Customizing the Slow Motion Effect</h2><p>When you are using the Photos app to add a slow motion effect to your videos, you can tweak it to your liking. You will be able to select the speed using a slider, which lets you get the precise slow motion effect that you desire.</p><p>There is also the handy option of being able to select the portion of your video where you want to add this effect. Say you are producing a longer video, where you want the effect in place for a few seconds.</p><p>Now you can select the beginning and end point using the bottom slider on the Photos app. Choose the precise starting and ending of the slow motion effect, and then watch through your video to ensure it is exactly as you want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-slow-motion-microsoft-photos.jpg"                      alt="slow motion video microsoft photos"                ></p><p>We recommend that you save your video file under a new name when you are done making your desired changes. It ensures that you still have the original copy of the video saved on your computer or external hard drive.</p><p>You can even create multiple versions of the file with the slow motion effect applied in different ways. Then you can watch the videos you just created to decide on the best version.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Use Story Remix to Edit a Video in Windows 10 Photos &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Edit-in-Slow-Motion-Online"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Edit-in-Slow-Motion-Online" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Edit in Slow Motion Online"></a>Part 3: How to Edit in Slow Motion Online</h2><p>If you are not able to access a Windows computer, you may want a solution that can be used online.

It makes the content editing process a hassle-free, creative, and enjoyable activity. Also, beginners and amateur content editors can easily use Affinity Photo.</p><p>No matter you are a professional content creator or a newbie, we’ll be discussing how to remove background in Affinity Photo. Let’s explore how to use the good editing tool to be free of the stressful editing process.</p><h2 id="How-to-Remove-Affinity-Photo-to-Remove-Image’s-Background"><a href="#How-to-Remove-Affinity-Photo-to-Remove-Image’s-Background" class="headerlink" title="How to Remove Affinity Photo to Remove Image’s Background"></a>How to Remove Affinity Photo to Remove Image’s Background</h2><p>Affinity Photo is a simple and easy-to-use editing software, and you can remove a background in it under two scenarios: remove a white or a busy background.</p><h3 id="How-to-Erase-a-White-Background-in-Affinity-Designer"><a href="#How-to-Erase-a-White-Background-in-Affinity-Designer" class="headerlink" title="How to Erase a White Background in Affinity Designer"></a>How to Erase a White Background in Affinity Designer</h3><p>To erase a white background in Affinity Designer, do these steps:</p><p>Step1 In the first step, install the <a class="link"   href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/" >Affinity Designer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>software and launch it on your computer. Go to <strong>“File” &gt; “Open”</strong> and head to the location of your image with a white background on your drive to import it.</p><p>Now access the <strong>Pixel Persona</strong> section in the left corner of the software screen by clicking the <strong>colored boxes</strong> icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/accessing-the-pixel-persona-in-affinity-designer.png"                      alt="accessing the pixel persona in affinity designer"                ></p><p>Step2 Go to the <strong>“Layers”</strong> tab in the right pane, right-click your layer, and disable <strong>“Lock.”</strong> Now right-click on your layer again, and select <strong>“Rasterize”</strong> to enable editing of specific parts of the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/unlocking-the-image-layer-in-affinity-designer.png"                      alt="unlocking the image layer in affinity designer"                ></p><p>Step3 To make a selection around your subject, first enable the <strong>“Snap To Edges”</strong> and <strong>“Soft Edges”</strong> feature from the top toolbar. This will help you automatically detect the edges and give it a more tapered finish.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/enabling-snap-to-edges-and-soft-edges-in-affinity-designer.png"                      alt="enabling snap to edges and soft edges in affinity designer"                ></p><p>Set your brush size using your keyboard’s <strong>left</strong> and <strong>right bracket</strong> keys. Now, manually make a selection around your subject and white edges in the image as precisely as possible.</p><p>Step4 Next, zoom in on your subject. Press &amp; hold the ALT key on your keyboard, and use the Selection Brush tool to manually correct the rough edges of your outline.</p><p>Click the <strong>“Refine”</strong> option in the toolbar to open the <strong>“Refine Selection”</strong> menu. A red mask will be applied to your subject, giving you an idea of how your image will look once you remove the background. Zoom in and if any details are excluded, paint them over. Once you are satisfied, click <strong>“Apply”</strong> to save your changes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/refining-the-outline-around-the-image-to-remove-background-in-affinity-designer.png"                      alt="refining the outline around the image to remove background in affinity designer"                ></p><p>Step5 In the last step, press the <strong>“Delete”</strong> key on your keyboard to remove the background, or click <strong>“Edit”</strong> and choose the <strong>“Cut”</strong> option.</p><p>Now, hit <strong>“Control+D”</strong> to deselect the selection.

Select your image and click <strong>“Open”</strong> to import your picture.</p><p>From the right-side panel, open the <strong>Layers</strong> tab and click the <strong>“Lock”</strong> icon to unlock your image layer, which is set as locked by default. Now, right-click on the layer and select <strong>“Rasterize &amp; Trim.”</strong> Rasterization will help remove the background.</p><p>Step2 Next, you have to make a selection around your object&#x2F;subject in the picture. Click the <strong>“Selection Brush”</strong> tool from the left-side panel to do so.</p><p>Now your cursor will be changed to a circle. To increase or decrease the brush size, use the <strong>Right</strong> and <strong>Left Bracket</strong> keys on your keyboard. Now, move around the brush on your image to outline your subject.</p><p>Step3 Once you’ve made a selection around your object, it’s time to refine it to make it more precise. To do so, click the <strong>“Refine”</strong> option from the top toolbar to open the <strong>“Refine Selection”</strong> menu.</p><p>Focus on the <strong>Foreground</strong> and <strong>Background</strong> brushes in the <strong>Refine Selection</strong> menu and toggle between these settings to make your selection more accurate. You can use the <strong>Right or Left Bracket</strong> key on your keyboard to adjust the brush size where needed.<br>Once satisfied with your changes, click the <strong>“Apply”</strong> option in the <strong>Refine Selection</strong> menu to save your settings.</p><p>Step4 Now that you’ve outlined your subject clearly and precisely, it’s time to remove the busy background. To do so, click the <strong>Delete key</strong> on your keyboard if you use a Windows PC.</p><p>If you are using a Mac system, click <strong>“Edit”</strong> in the toolbar and select <strong>“Cut”</strong> from the drop-down menu. Your background will be removed and changed to a checkboard pattern.</p><p>Step5 In this last step, you must deselect the outline around your subject. For this, press the <strong>“Control+D”</strong> key on your keyboard or click <strong>“Select”</strong> in the toolbar and choose the <strong>“Deselect”</strong> option.</p><p>Finally, click <strong>“File”</strong> and select the <strong>“Export”</strong> option from the drop-down menu.

This is an essential part of a game.</p><p> New way of detecting a person’s presence in a game is bio-sensing. These are small sensors which are attached to a data glove, suit or even the body and record movements made by that person in a 3D space. These movements are interpreted by a computer and trigger a variety of responses within that space. These movements are fed back to a computer which then analyses the data and uses it to transform your actions into the appropriate responses on the screen. It was 20 years ago that consumer-level virtual reality last looked likely to touch down, and if you got burned by Nintendo’s ill-fated Virtual Boy or dropped a bundle on theVFX1 Headgear, then you’re likely to be looking at the new crop of virtual reality entertainment technology with some skepticism.</p><h3 id="Virtual-Museums"><a href="#Virtual-Museums" class="headerlink" title="Virtual Museums"></a>Virtual Museums</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/virtual-museums.jpg"                      alt="virtual-museums"                ></p><p> Use of virtual reality in museum and historical settings e.g. visitor centers, interactive exhibitions. Interactive displays form a large part of many exhibitions and particularly appeal to children. Children are often difficult to attract at a museum or gallery, as they tend to see this as a boring experience. But the use of interactive technologies such as virtual reality entertainment has changed that perception and opened up these spaces to a new audience. This is a useful way of changing attitudes towards heritage sites such as museums and to encourage more people to visit and take part.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130529/26400" target="_top" id="2130529">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130529" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130529/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Galleries"><a href="#Galleries" class="headerlink" title="Galleries"></a>Galleries</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/virtual-galleries.png"                      alt="virtual-galleries"                ></p><p> Immersive 3-D experience allows students to manipulate virtual objects and experience whatever they’re studying firsthand.

It also gives you characters that really are supernatural and paranormal, which sometimes we can’t physically do.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135398/19272" target="_top" id="2135398">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135398" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135398/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Music-VR-experience"><a href="#Music-VR-experience" class="headerlink" title="Music VR experience"></a>Music VR experience</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/music-vr-experience.jpg"                      alt="music-vr-experience"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1770776">                    <video width="240" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770776.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1770776">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770776.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftokenmetrics.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1770776%2F20702'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1770776/20702"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Music is a game changer. If your sound isn’t at par, then the whole project can fall flat. Soon you will be able to strap on a headset and spend a day immersed in the life of almost anyone on earth. Just pop on a pair of virtual reality goggles and get ready to live a superstar’s life.</p><p> Virtual reality entertainment is the creation of a virtual environment presented to our senses in such a way that we experience it as if we were really there. It uses a host of technologies to achieve this goal and is a technically complex feat that has to account for our perception and cognition. We can expect to see many more innovative uses for the technology in the future and perhaps a fundamental way in which we communicate and work, thanks to the possibilities of virtual reality.</p><h2 id="Future-of-Virtual-Reality-entertainment"><a href="#Future-of-Virtual-Reality-entertainment" class="headerlink" title="Future of Virtual Reality entertainment"></a>Future of Virtual Reality entertainment</h2><p> It allows the person to view three-dimensional images and these images appear life-sized to the person. The aim is for a seamless connection between the person’s head and eye movements and the appropriate response (change in perception). This ensures that the virtual environment is both realistic and enjoyable. The objective is for a natural, free-flowing form of interaction that results in a memorable experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-top-9-invisible-media-extractors/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Top 9 Invisible Media Extractors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/complete-bundle-of-macxdvd-professional-edition-with-full-licensing-complimentary-migration/"><u>Complete Bundle of MacXDVD Professional Edition with Full Licensing – Complimentary Migration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/fashion-forward-video-ideas/"><u>Fashion Forward Video Ideas</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-music-from-honor-v-purse-to-ipod-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Music from Honor V Purse to iPod | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-apple-iphone-14-plus-when-we-dont-have-apple-id-or-password-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock Apple iPhone 14 Plus When We Dont Have Apple ID or Password?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/life360-learn-how-everything-works-on-motorola-moto-g04-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Life360 Learn How Everything Works On Motorola Moto G04 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/top-10-image-editors-and-annotation-tools/"><u>Top 10 Image Editors & Annotation Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/unbeatable-oneplus-promotions-for-the-holiday-sales-season/"><u>Unbeatable OnePlus Promotions for the Holiday Sales Season</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/unlocking-11-pros-window-secrets/"><u>Unlocking 11 Pro's Window Secrets</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

How to live stream with Online OneStream"></a>Part 3. How to live stream with Online OneStream</h2><p>Live streaming with OneStream is pretty straightforward. I will walk you through a series of steps you can follow to live stream using OneStream successfully.</p><p>Step1 First, head to <a class="link"   href="https://app.onestream.live/signup" >OneStream live website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and create an account. Just input a username, password, and email address. After that, you need to choose a plan. OneStream offers 4 plans, as I have mentioned above. Just go through the plan features and choose the one that best suits you.</p><p>Step2 After you have successfully picked a plan, on the dashboard, you will see 40 top social platforms, and you will be requested to add your social accounts. If you can’t see the social platform you want to live stream to, you can use custom RTMP to stream it. Except for Instagram, you can connect all of your social accounts directly.</p><p>To connect your Instagram account, you must utilize a third-party software called Instafeed. Instead, it will construct your Instagram account’s Sync URL. Once the URL is generated, please copy and paste it into the OneStream Sync URL section. It will successfully connect your Instagram account to OneStream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/live-stream-with-onestream-1.jpg"                      alt="connect onstream to your social accounts"                ></p><p>Step3 To schedule your live stream on the dashboard, click the “three-line” button.

For example, the main difference between cloth vendors&#x2F;manufacturers is brand identity. In a simple term, “what makes your brand different from the competitors?” – your logo is one of the answers. <strong>Free logo templates</strong> are easy to use, customizable, and applicable for brand promotion and recognition. Although most <strong>logo templates</strong> are customizable, some are not editable. This article talks about editable and not editable free logo templates. Learn more below.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Free-logo-templates-Editable"><a href="#Part-1-Free-logo-templates-Editable" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Free logo templates (Editable)"></a>Part 1: Free logo templates (Editable)</h2><p>Editable logo templates differ from other templates because they support modification and diversification. Customizing a template gives total access and quality creation in your care. In short, if it is editable, you remove, add, and save a modified version of a logo template. All logo makers are not free or easy to edit; however, some editable free logo templates include:</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.canva.com/create/logos/"><strong>Canva</strong></a></li></ol><p>Canva is an essential logo template maker. You can do more with the editable logo template creator because it contains several collections of logo templates that serve as the basis for your logo creation. You may not necessarily subscribe to the premium package if you do not need the premium files. You can learn more about Canva, especially how to create logo templates, from the official website.</p><p>The website gives full access to all users, educating them on how to use the Canva tool for better logo making. Canva AI algorithm suggests designs based on your history. For example, you locate resourceful raw collections for projects without much stress. The beautiful algorithm feature is important if you create more than one logo.</p><p>The Canva (free) feature includes free download (limited resolution), limited editing tools, and unlimited space work. You must create an account before accessing the official website editing tool since the software does not require an editor to make changes or customize a template.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/canva.jpg"                      alt="canva official homepage"                ></p><ol><li><strong>Adobe</strong></li></ol><p>Adobe has software for logo making and design; however, <a class="link"   href="https://express.adobe.com/express-apps/logo-maker/" >Adobe Create Logo Maker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an official website option, allows direct free logo making.

Adobe has outstanding features that put it above the competition: vector graphics, scaling, and quality maintenance.</p><p>All designs come from a basic idea; with Adobe, you can amplify your idea into a captivating logo – this is possible with the vector graphics. Logos are naturally simple and small; however, if you need a high print logo for your company, especially a 3D inscription, you may need Adobe vector graphics. The vector graphics put you at a high resolution to size ratio: maintaining a quality resolution irrespective of the log size.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/adobe-express.jpg"                      alt="adobe logo maker"                ></p><p>Tips: Adobe also provides a lot of well-customized templates involving various styles and types.

The software’s list of watermarking features includes options like Signature, Arc Text, StegoMark or Metadata that enable you to add visible and invisible watermarks to your photos and videos. iWatermark also offers batch processing feature so that you can simultaneously add watermarks with the exact same settings to multiple images.</p><h4 id="2-uMark"><a href="#2-uMark" class="headerlink" title="2. uMark"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://www.uconomix.com/Products/uMark/" >uMark <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free version available, $29 for a full version of the software</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS, iOS</p><p>There are different options of the software available, so you can opt for uMark Photo Watermarker if you’re only working with photos or you can use uMark Video Watermarker in case you often upload videos to the Internet. The app lets you use both text and images as watermarks on your photos, and it also offers powerful batch processing options that automate the process of watermarking large amounts of images. In addition to conventional watermarking options, uMark also lets you watermark your photos with QR codes or different shapes.

The Arclab Watermark Studio is equipped with image resizing tools which makes it a perfect choice for photographers who often post their work on social media.</p><h4 id="4-TSR-Watermark-Image"><a href="#4-TSR-Watermark-Image" class="headerlink" title="4. TSR Watermark Image"></a>4. <a class="link"   href="https://www.watermark-image.com/" >TSR Watermark Image <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, subscription plans start at $29.95</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS</p><p>Professional photographers who have previous experience with photo editing software, won’t need too much time to get used to TSR Watermark Image.

The images that were taken with Canon, Sony, Nikon, and numerous other cameras can also be watermarked through metadata. The TSR Watermark Image app provides a rich selection of special effects, borders, and crosses that let you create stylish watermarks. The free version of this photo watermarking software offers only a limited amount of options and if you want to gain access to more than 200 fonts or advanced uploading features you must purchase one of the available subscription plans.</p><h4 id="5-Mass-Watermark"><a href="#5-Mass-Watermark" class="headerlink" title="5. Mass Watermark"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://www.masswatermark.com/" >Mass Watermark <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, $30 for a lifetime license</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows</p><p>As its name suggests, Mass Watermark is designed to make the process of watermarking large quantities of photos quick and simple.

Watermark Software"></a>6. <a class="link"   href="https://www.watermark-software.com/" >Watermark Software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, $24.90 for a lifetime license</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p><p>The fact that you can watermark up to 300 photos in just one minute with this photo watermarking software speaks volumes about its capabilities. In fact, you can watermark all your photos with Watermark Software in just three easy steps, since you just have to import the images to which you want to add a watermark, insert text or picture you’d like to use as a watermark and wait for the app to process them. The Watermark Tiling feature makes unauthorized usage of your work even more difficult, while the EXIF editor enables you to add watermarks to a photo’s metadata. The free version of the app offers only a limited number of features, and you must purchase the lifetime license if want to use all the watermarking tools this app has to offer.</p><h4 id="7-Alamoon-Watermark"><a href="#7-Alamoon-Watermark" class="headerlink" title="7. Alamoon Watermark"></a>7. <a class="link"   href="https://alamoon.com/watermark-editor.html" >Alamoon Watermark <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p><p>Despite being slightly outdated, Alamoon Watermark software is still a reliable option for all photographers who are looking for a simple way to add watermarks to their photos. This editor supports a broad range of photo file formats and it is capable of processing thousands of images in just a couple of minutes. However, it lacks advanced watermarking and photo editing tools, so enhancing the colors in a photo or creating watermark templates is not possible with Alamoon Watermark app. The professional version of this watermarking software is largely overpriced and there are more powerful and more affordable options available.</p><h4 id="8-Star-Watermark"><a href="#8-Star-Watermark" class="headerlink" title="8. Star Watermark"></a>8. <a class="link"   href="https://www.star-watermark.com/" >Star Watermark <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free version available, pricing plans start at $17 for a lifetime license</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows</p><p>Customizing each watermark you create with this cross-platform app is a straightforward process that won’t take more than a few minutes of your time. You can easily alter the size of the text, change its color, add shadows or position the text anywhere in the photo. Star Watermark enables its users to use images as watermarks or even create multilayered watermarks. The batch processing features, however, remain one of the most common reasons why professional photographers opt to use the Star Watermark software. Unfortunately, the app doesn’t offer any of the advanced watermarking features, and it doesn’t allow you to use your digital signature as a watermark.</p><h4 id="9-Visual-Watermark"><a href="#9-Visual-Watermark" class="headerlink" title="9. Visual Watermark"></a>9. <a class="link"   href="https://www.visualwatermark.com/" >Visual Watermark <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, pricing plans start at $19.95 for a lifetime license</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows, Android</p><p>The Visual Watermark software makes watermarking hundreds of photos in a short period of time look easy. Besides watermarking photos, you can also use the Visual Watermark application to add watermarks to videos. There are 260 fonts available, but you can also import your own custom-made fonts and use them to create watermarks. The software adjusts the size and the position of the watermark to each photo automatically, but you can also fine-tune each of these settings manually. Most importantly, the Visual Watermark software protects your images from artificial intelligence algorithms that remove watermarks from photos automatically by making minor changes to the template you’re applying to the photos you’re processing.</p><h4 id="10-Water-Marquee"><a href="#10-Water-Marquee" class="headerlink" title="10. Water Marquee"></a>10. <a class="link"   href="https://www.watermarquee.com/" >Water Marquee <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Web-based</p><p>This online watermarking tool enables you to create your own watermarks or use fully customizable templates to protect your images. The process of adding a watermark to a photo with Water Marquee is remarkably simple, as you just have to upload a photo to the platform and click on the Add Text, Add Logo or Use Template option. You can then proceed to insert the text, select its size, color or font and decide if you want to use a solid or transparent background. When done, simply click on the Save icon and choose the destination folder on your hard drive in which the watermarked photo is going to be stored.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>There is no way to control what happens to the photos you share on your website or on your social media accounts because people can share, repost or download them with a single click. The best way to reduce the chances of unsanctioned use of your work is to watermark all the pictures you share online. Which photo watermarking software do you use to copyright your photos?

Most of the headsets have the ability to track the user’s head movements so that the wherever the user looks, the character in the virtual reality also looks. If done in the right manner, the headsets give an impression of the user being actually inside the game or the movie, hence the name “virtual reality”.</p><h2 id="How-does-Virtual-Reality-headsets-work"><a href="#How-does-Virtual-Reality-headsets-work" class="headerlink" title="How does Virtual Reality headsets work"></a>How does Virtual Reality headsets work</h2><p> The principle goal of the virtual reality headsets is to create life-size, 3D virtual environments with no boundaries like those associated with computer or television screens. In case of the Rift or HTC’s Vive, video is sent from the computer or the console to the headset through a HDMI cable, while for the Google Cardboard or Samsung’s Gear VR, the videos are already on the smartphone mounted on the headsets.</p><p> The VR headsets may use a single feed or two feeds sent directly to either one or two LCD displays, one for each eye. There are also a set of lenses placed between the user’s eyes and the pixels and this is the reason why the devices are sometimes referred to as goggles. In some cases, the lenses can be adjusted to match the distance between the eyes and this distance will also vary from one user to another.</p><p> The lenses will focus and reshape the images for each eye before creating a stereoscopic 3D image by positioning the 2D images to portray how each of the two eyes see the world. One way in which the virtual reality headsets increases immersion is by increasing the field of view or simply how wide a picture appears. A 360 degrees display may not be convenient and most of the high end VR headsets usually use 100 or 110 degree field of views, which is usually sufficient enough to give the effects.</p><p> And for the final images to be totally convincing, the VR headsets use minimum frame rates of 60fps to do away with shuttering or make the users feel sick.</p><h2 id="Top-VR-headsets-overview"><a href="#Top-VR-headsets-overview" class="headerlink" title="Top VR headsets overview"></a>Top VR headsets overview</h2><p> The race by tech giants to get their share of the virtual reality market is on and company after company is burning the midnight oil to produce the next best headset.</p><p> Below is a list of the various VR headsets currently available to purchase:</p><h3 id="HTC-Vive"><a href="#HTC-Vive" class="headerlink" title="HTC Vive"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.vive.com/" >HTC Vive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/htc-vive.png"                      alt="ghtc-vive-vr"                ></p><p> HTC Vive VR headset is made in collaboration with Valve and it plugs directly into PCs and uses Valve’s humongous gaming ecosystem. The headset has over 70 sensors to allow for 360 degrees head tracking and it also boasts of a 90Hz refresh rate responsible for keeping down the latency, which in turn saves the users from suffering motions sickness. This headset is currently available for purchase from $799.</p><h3 id="Samsung-Gear-VR"><a href="#Samsung-Gear-VR" class="headerlink" title="Samsung Gear VR"></a><a class="link"   href="http://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/gear-vr/" >Samsung Gear VR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gear-vr.png"                      alt="gear-vr"                ></p><p> The Samsung Gear VR is essentially Oculus Rift lite, owing to the fact that the two companies worked on the technology together. The Gear VR uses a Samsung Galaxy smartphone for the display and as the processor. The phone slots in front of the lenses and into a Micro USB slot, and uses the super AMOLED display as the screen. With the Gear, all you have to do is to slot in the phone, put on the headset and start enjoying the virtual reality experience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/2139563/4704" target="_top" id="2139563">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-2139563" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/2139563/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Oculus-Rift"><a href="#Oculus-Rift" class="headerlink" title="Oculus Rift"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.oculus.com/rift/" >Oculus Rift <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/oculus-rift.jpg"                      alt="oculus-rift"                ></p><p> Oculus Rift headset was responsible for the current hysteria in virtual reality. The Rift plugs into the computer’s USB and DVI ports and tracks the movements of the head to provide 3D displays on its stereo screens. The consumer edition of the Rift comes with a 2160 x 1200 resolution as well as a refresh rate of 90Hz. The Rift matches HTC Vive in terms of the refresh rate, but lags behind Sony’s PlayStation VR, though it is a pretty advanced VR headset in terms of the technology used.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115936/19272" target="_top" id="2115936">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115936" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115936/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Sony-PlayStation-VR"><a href="#Sony-PlayStation-VR" class="headerlink" title="Sony PlayStation VR"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/playstation-vr/" >Sony PlayStation VR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sony-playstation-vr.jpg"                      alt="sony-playstation-vr"                ></p><p> Sony has finally announced the launch date for the PlayStation VR headset and this is expected to be 13th October 2016. A new version though, was announced way back in 2015 and it featured a 5-inch LCD display of the original prototype. For the version to be released, it is expected to have a 5.7 inch OLED to allow for low persistence which will in turn translate to less motion blur. The refresh rate for Sony’s PlayStation VR has been ramped up to 120Hz, making it possible to have 120fps gaming.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983551">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983551.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983551">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983551.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983551%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983551/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Google-Cardboard"><a href="#Google-Cardboard" class="headerlink" title="Google Cardboard"></a><a class="link"   href="https://vr.google.com/cardboard/" >Google Cardboard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-cardboard-vr.jpg"                      alt="google-cardboard-vr"                ></p><p> Not to be left behind, Google also has a cardboard virtual reality headset. With this headset, it sounds like popping your smartphone in a cardboard container and putting it over your head for a virtual reality experience. Sounds like a joke, but you will be pleasantly surprised to learn that it works like charm and it is also low cost. If anything, the smartphone you have already has all the gyroscopic sensors as well as the positioning devices needed to track your head movements.</p><p> Since the Cardboard has grown so much in terms of popularity, Google has planned to release a better version known as Daydream. This will be a device like the Gear VR, but it has been designed to work with android phones which are currently being revamped to over better VR experiences. It is still not know when the new device will be available, but the Cardboard is retailing at $16.99 at Amazon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-infinite-loop-twitters-live-video-saga-in-23/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Infinite Loop Twitter's Live Video Saga in '23</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/updated-capture-and-structure-knowledge-via-mematic/"><u>[Updated] Capture and Structure Knowledge via Mematic</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-maximize-attendee-visibility-with-google-meet-grids/"><u>2024 Approved Maximize Attendee Visibility with Google Meet Grids</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/download-the-latest-hevc-video-coding-format-support-in-vlc-media-player-no-cost/"><u>Download the Latest Hevc Video Coding Format Support in VLC Media Player - No Cost!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-change-location-on-facebook-dating-for-your-vivo-y27s-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Change Location On Facebook Dating for your Vivo Y27s | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/navigating-spotifys-ad-marketplace-successfully/"><u>Navigating Spotify's Ad Marketplace Successfully</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/scribing-success-engaging-examples-for-podcasts/"><u>Scribing Success Engaging Examples for Podcasts</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

On the other side if we talk about audio abilities then LG360 has an edge over Samsung Gear 360 because of its ability to record 5.1 level surround sounds that is major requirement of a 360 degree video. The Gear 360 possess stereo record feature that can capture voice only in two directions thus resultant audio in scenes is not that much clear. Moving forward to more technical specifications, the bit rate – well known as quality of image with resolution is 60MB&#x2F;second in case of Gear 360 whereas LG360 cam limits up to 19MB&#x2F;second, this makes a big difference in quality. If we count features then Samsung gear 360 definitely have more features as like its waterproof body, highly stabilized video results and F2.0 dual lenses but LG360 lacks behind in these features.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982596">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982596.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982596">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982596.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982596%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982596/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Editing-software-comparison-comparison"><a href="#Part-4-Editing-software-comparison-comparison" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 Editing software comparison comparison"></a>Part 4 Editing software comparison comparison</h2><p>It is possible to stitch videos as well as photographs taken from the 360 degree camera using Galaxy phone and they can be directly shared on social media. Some consumers also love to use Desktop software to edit the camera results in detail. Same as like Gear 360, the latest device from LG can also capture good quality 360 degree videos as well as photographs but it do not support spherical share as like Samsung unit. You can pair up LG360 cam only with LG G5 latest smartphone whereas video and photo editing options are not yet known for smartphone as well as PC. Both these devices come with Wi-Fi connectivity, USB port and Bluetooth capabilities whereas in case of Samsung 360 gear NFC is an additional option.
